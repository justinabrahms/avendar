Allright, I'll start from the beginning.  I have the axe M'aalir, I get killed, it is looted.  I find out Pintir has it.
I don't see him for a VERY long time.  My thought, he is avoiding playing cause he knows im gonna come after that axe.
In any case, many days later, I spot Pintir, I tell him "I want my axe"  He says its his, I take my party to the knights
of Enarai, he is in the room of scales.  We attack the guards.  Poof, he quits out.  After just saying hello to numerous people in the realms.
He KNEW we wera fter him.  I am sure Aeli is writing a note, she can confirm.
Thanks for listening

The reason I have to go is simple.  I have to get home to get ready for
work.  I asked you if I could go, and you said 'no', so I remained some time
(hiding, of course.)  I'm sorry that you died, but that is what happens.  As
to your accusations of hoarding, the only reason I have the same stuff is
because I have yet to lose it.  I don't simply hoard.  I am hardly afraid of
risking my eq and my neck, and have nearly died many times doing so
(Attacking you at the bouncer, for instance, or when you were with Jader). 
It isn't like I'll never log on again.  I log on quite often.  You'll have
plenty of chances at your revenge, I'm sure.

Good day Champions.  I am Ganindor honored of the braka pack, native of

calling.  I have been trained in the use of the blade by some of the best
Swordmasters in the realms, and I offer you my skills in all you seek to
uphold.  During my travels I have seen and experienced the evil of the land
first hand.  And have done everything in my power to see it stopped.  My
heart is just and I am willing to charge into the battle of good and evil
with my blades raised high.  I feel that the path of darkness is one no soul
should follow.  One day I hope that all the people of the land will be able
to walk freely without fear of falling victim to the crimes some commit. 
This is a task no one being can do alone thus one of the reasons I seek to

I've spent the early years of my life in Yithoul where I was born.  In my

learned the ways of the watchers guild so that I may better bring justice to
the wretched scum that would see the collapse of what we protect.

Greetings, Brothers and Sisters of the Champions.

Please consider this note writ on the behalf of Xor and myself. I write on an
occurrance that happened during Xor and my mission to feed and clothe the hungry 
and needy within Bandor, Earendam, and Gaald
from which we have recently returned.

I write of the visions.


From what we understand, Ealiryon, Brachaormaul, Malusmi, and Ralisaren have had these
dreams. Brachaormaul's happened while he was in a place of great darkness, which might
be a clue as to their meanings. All of the visions included the feeling of an unseen
presence fading into view from the blackness, oft in the form of a blindingly radiant
light.  As much as Xor wants to believe that this may be an ascent for him, I highly
doubt this. *here there is an illegible smudge, probably caused by a quick jerk of the
writer's arm*


At the same time, I also wonder how certain conclusions on the meaning of the visions
have been reached. Ralisaren seemed intent on stating that it was a portend of war, but
how this was come to, I cannot comprehend. None of the visions, as far as I know, 
incorporated violence or anger or destruction. Only peace and light. Perhaps this speaks
to the temperament of Ralisaren himself.
Brachaormaul offered that they may signify a long hard road on which all of the walkers
of the Light must toil to come to a greater reward. This, too, seems like an odd 
conclusion, considering that there was little toil or hardship given to the light as it
shone through the darkness. The stories from my bretheren Malusmi and Ealiryon, have we
yet to hear, as we have not had the opportunity to talk with either of them since we
returned.


After long periods of thinking on the subject, Xor and I believe that the idea that the
light signifies a new Divine Presence on the side of the Truth and the Light is most likely
the best answer at this juncture.  No other idea addresses the fact that all visions
felt a new, unseen presence. We do not believe that these visions are something to fear
or try to hide from, but rather something to embrace and eagerly await further actions by
our Great God, Lord Jolinn, or any of His compatriots.


Please, all of you, do write to Xor and me of your thoughts on this scroll, or speak
to us on it in person.  We believe that this issue is of great importance to the Champions,
and the entire land of Avendar as a whole.


Thank you for reading,
Pfusch.

It has come to my attention that the Axe once wielded by yourself, has
come into the hands of Bastahvilist.  This would most often be none of my
business, however the nature of how you retrieved the axe has begged my
involvement.  

The axe is solely the property of the protector of Lord Malyn.  You were
granted its use based on the trust and spirit you have shown in the realms
throughout your life, and Melaith has judged you worthy.  

And now I see that you've granted the axe to another, whom Melaith would not
find worthy, in any light.  Now, whether he's given you his word or not, the
fact remains that Bastahvilist has done many "vile" things in his lifetime. 
And though these do not make him inherently a bad man, he still remains
unworthy of the axe.  

I would ask that you re-take the axe from Bastahvilist and either wield it
yourself or return it to Melaith.  I remind you, that this is what I ask,
not demand.  I do not judge you for such an action, merely tell you of an

Dearest Brachaormaul,

I understand your concern in the issue of the Axe and wish to offer
greater depth of detail in how the axe came to me and what its
purpose in my hands was.

A few weeks past, Bastahvilist had the axe himself. How he came upon
it, I do not know, but he seemed to have had it for years. One day, he
was attacked and the axe was thieved from his body by some shadow-dwelling
being.  Eventually, the axe worked its way back to its rightful owner, 
Sir Melaith.

Bastahvilist went to retrieve the axe, but Melaith did not find him worthy,
for the reasons you had mentioned. After a short argument, the two got in
a fight, which made for the end of Bastahvilist. After his death, he came
to me and asked my aid in retrieving his axe. I did not wish to harm Sir
Melaith for any reason, so I declined. A friend Spirit Scholar went to
Melaith and requested the axe from him, later giving it to myself for
keeping. This was done to prevent physical harm from befalling the good
Sir Melaith *and* to prevent an untimely end for Bastahvilist, who has
always acted as a friend to Armaril.

I confronted Bastahvilist later about the incident, and asked him why he
did what he did and what he had learned from his experience. He gave me
his word to never bring blade to Sir Melaith again, and also promised
that if ever he loses the axe again he will not pursue violent means in
retrieving it.  Xor and I found this satisfactory, and since this 
compromise prevented bloodshed either from Sir Melaith or from 
Bastahvilist himself, we presented the axe to him once again.

Despite the fact that his people have had a hard time differentiating
Good and Evil since the Sundering, I do believe that Bastahvilist is
a kind soul, and that with proper guidance, he may even be worthy of
walking the halls of Armaril- a subject which he has inquired about to
Xor and myself more than once.


By showing mercy and kindness to all, Xor and I agree that this situation
is resolved. If you have any further questions, I'm open to speaking with
you on it.  Your concern is quite understandable, and I am heartened by it.

I look forward to seeing you again soon, Brachaormaul.
Pfusch.

is to leave it with the bank in Var Bandor as that way it can not be stolen

of knowing all to well.  Another thing is that I would like to have you all

will become the new high lord of the knights.  I am having some problems
with myself however in the fact that it seems that I have brought upon me
some sort of wrath.  I have recently been betrayed by friends and those that
i know well enouph to aid.  My trust has been abused, and therefor is
receeding greatly.  I have plans that I would like to talk over with the
both of you at some great length when time permits, but this is neither the
manner in which I will speak them, not they way in wich I wish them spoken. 
I would like for the both of you to know that my trust in you has not been
altered in the least bit and still remains stronger than ever.  The vault
sounds as though it is coming along nicely enouph, but let us not foget that
we will have to hire guards for both it, and throughout the temple.  And
poerhaps even expand the temple somewhat in size to accomodate its needs as
we grow.  THis can be planned out at a later date as well seeing as the
amount of gold we need it rather large, and not yet with us.  To you both I
ask that you would hold for me what you can find, and perhaps give it to me
when you next see me, I am in great need of most things save a breastplate
at the moent.  This is a sad day in my life that this would happen but as I

have found a peace unlike any other as Leader of the Khajjyk.  

With the death of the elder shaman of my tribe, Rhalgayir, I had once

a man sought me and found me worthy.  The Son of Jolinn, Akraelyn, has
inspired me.  And though the hardship of his life can be seen in his eyes,
the light of hope and strength shines through.  

It is this feeling that brings me to your altar.  I have much to learn and
explore yet in this land, but I know now that I need not do it alone.  The
scripture of your faith guides me along the path that Fate has foretold -
and it seems my footing only grows more stable with each step.  

I shall make my prayers known to you often, and seek to find an altar worthy
of praying from.  I shall cherish the day you see my worth and allow me to

about following you.  She was still killing ambassadors in Kor Thrandir and
the like though.  She said if you wanted her to stop you'd say so.  Dunno
about that, really.  Never was much for depending on a god to tell me what I
can't do.  I guess she stopped that awhile ago though, she seems pretty

This is to tell you of what has happened between the tower of the
champions and our own temple.  There tower held all ten of the coveted, and
the scales indicated such a thing, so I took actions and enlisted the aid of
the supposedly reformed Bastahvilist, Rilistrac, and a hopefull knight
Voxanan.  We took the tower rather easily, and collected everything that was
held in there vault with little knowledge of my own.  I had no intent of
taking what they held, but it seems the others had other intentions. 
Needless to say bastahvilist is no longer to be trusted, nor aided by one of
our knighthood, and I would like the captains to vote this in place as he is
a treacherous fool, that shall be dealt with under the laws of the lady.  He
Foolishly handed the stones to Ilae, and therefor tipped the scales once
more.  It shall not happen again that I will be decieved in such a mannor as
this.  Brachaormaul has proposed that we form a treaty of sorts, stating
that they being the tower of champions shall hand over the stones to us,
when they are deemed by our scales to be to powerfull.  And if there is no
one present to do so that we will be bale to take them from there halls with
no worries of pursuit.  The one thing that he asked was that we do it with
the brotherhood alone, and that we leave intact what they had gathered. 
This again is not my decision, yet I offer it to you as I should since it
was told to me.  

As for the commings of our own vault we have collected nearly half of what
we need to do so, but woiuld think that we should expand the temple beyond
the size that it is now, to what extreme I am not sure.  Sentries should
also b e posted so that any fool that trys our sacred halls is not done so
easily.  I would like to inquire as to when you three think that the voting
for the new High Lord and captains should take place.  We have been without
a leader, save Pintir whom has done a good job in his own right, for many
many years now.  As for myself, Takul was witness to a new era of my own
being as I have been through some great changes as of late, not all of them
being so good in themselves.  BUt that can be explained by either Takul or
Myself.  That is all that I can write now as I am growing tired, and must
rest, do let krainsan know of the contents of this letter, as I have somehow
forgotten my old friend.  Be well all, and walk with the eye of Enaerai upon
you at all times.

logs.  

Wed Apr 10 06:11:51 2002 :: Athukel is attempting to murder Atherik in room 1354
Wed Apr 10 06:11:58 2002 :: Atherik is attempting to murder Athukel in room 1353
Wed Apr 10 06:15:58 2002 :: Closing link to Atherik.
Wed Apr 10 06:38:25 2002 :: Atherik has quit.

Wed Apr 10 11:41:23 2002 :: Atherik is attempting to murder Jardon in room 3513
Wed Apr 10 11:44:05 2002 :: Closing link to Atherik.
Wed Apr 10 12:00:21 2002 :: Atherik has quit.
****
Things to note: In the first log, Athukel initiated, but they moved over
a room, after which Atherik initiated, implying that he was not on his way
out and trying to run away.  

In the second log, there's less than 3 minutes between the attempt (probably
a waylay attempt) and the quitting, which is damning evidence that requires
virtually no explanation.

Sirs and Ladies of Aramril,

I, Aeli Iristae, have penned this scroll that I may have the opportunity to
enter into the brotherhood that is the Champions of Avendar.  This is not a
simple decision, but rather one I have contemplated for many months now. 
However, I feel that it is right for me to do.  

Firstly, I would like to tell you about who I am, and why I have chosen this
course of action.  I am, of course, Aeli Iristae.  I was the only daughter
of my mother, Tyrali.  Unfortunately, my mother went away before I could
remember, so my grandmother says.  I am noble born, but it has done little
for me in my lifetime, especially since I left home to take up my studies as
a psion.  I have met many people during my lifetime, but few have had more
impact than Brachaormaul and Rulan.  I was awed by Brachaormaul's prowess
and zealous attitude, which first drew me to the tower.  After meeting
Rulan, I knew for certain that this was the right decision.  

I never really considered myself a violent person.  I try to make myself
affable, and easily approachable.  It seems to work, for many speak to me
without misapprehension.  I don't believe that violence is the answer, for
in death lies more problems.  I try my hardest to find a mutually agreeable
way out of a situation, but sometimes that can fail.  However, should
justice be metered out, I do not hesitate when force is required.  

I hope to see, during my lifetime, the influence of the Champions of Avendar
expanded.  There are many who simply have no need for the light or its
teachings, and that is something I wish to change.  In the light, lies true
hapiness, something many people strive to attain, but have not been shown
the way.  If given the opportunity, I would not mind the attempt to spread
the word of Jolinn, whom I am completely dedicated to.  I try to do as much
already, and will continue to do so.  

Until you call for me, I await.
Aeli Iristae, Mistress of the Mind.

It has been sometimes since last we have communicated with each other,
Champions.  I do hope that nothing of dire consequence has transpired.  I
would not liked to have missed anything that could have been prevented.  

Changing of subject: I have completed Brachaormauls charge to the best of my
ability.  I will restate the basic layout of what he asked me to accomplish.


Brachaormaul requested that I seek out others, to learn what they have lost,
and to understand what it means, and feels to lose what is dear.  It did not
matter whom I spoke with, nor should it have.  I must admit that I only
spoke with one person.  

This person of whom I spoke to made her home within the fortress of Krilin. 
Of course, most of you know of the constant raids made upon the fortress by
the hill giants.  The woman had lost her husband in a raid long ago,
followed by her son, only a few years later.  She was saddened to recall
these past memories, to my great displeasure.  But in the end, it was for
the best.  I was too stubborn to realize this.  Lady Rystaia herself had
helped me realize what happiness and freedom I had brought to the once grief
stricken woman.  I understand why she had mourned for so long, and I helped
her, and myself, to realize that the ones we love, care for, etc, have a
purpose in life.  Her husband died, to protect what he loved: the safety of
his family and the populous of Krilin.  Her son, died for the same cause,
following his fathers footsteps.  She had not realized that in their death,
she would live.  They had not died in vain, but died heroically and with
honor.  -Andeur Anpeol.

After that, they have ta answer five questions regardin' tha order. Then they'll be sworn

If you do not respond I will not be surprised, but here is the case:
Teliglix waylayed Takul and dual-bsed him(missed the second time). Of course, Takul got away and slept.
In the pursuit that followed, Teliglix found a place to quit and did so. Is this not
worthy of the slay/purge thing that was enacted on me? If not, PLEASE state the reason.

This is to explain some concerns I have with the new policies, and it
would be interesting to know what Takul and Alantranz thinks as well.  I
think this is all great points, but here are the problems I see.  I will
comment each policy, explaining the pros and cons of each, as I see it.  

First, the sponsor..  It was already to some extend done, but this is a good
idea to make this a requirement.  

Second, the three quests.  While it sound like a good way to prove their
devotion, it might be a little too much, but it all depends on what kind of
quests.  Third policy, the five questions.  I have nothing against that, on
the contrary, however, some of the questions should be chosen depending on
which captain the Knight will take order from.  At least two questions
should be different if the initiate will be part of Mett, Idris or Ilthar. 


For the title requirement, I think 45th title is too high, and it would be
quite unfair to many.  As you know, I don't even myself hold this title, and
I'm captain..  Which shows not only Heroes can be Knights.  And another
reason we need this requirement to be lower is that imbalance can comes from
everyone, even younger ones.  So how can we restore it if we can't even
reach them?  

The decision is still yours in the end, High Lord, but those were my
concerns.  

Jiskadar, Captain of Idris

In regard to the scrolls that the rest of you have written, I offer you
this to think upon.  In regard to the titles that they should require, I
should lean towards my fellow captains in that there has been times that
Takul and I have seen the scales imbalanced and not had a way to balance
them as they were distrought over the youth of the lands.  

As for the quests that they should be put upon perhaps they should be put
upon these quests by the captains that they shall serve under?  Being as the
diffrent branches have diffrent ways of keeping the balance in check.  Mine
is much more oriented towards a battle than the thinking and magic ways of
Jiskadar's lot.  We all have our own ways of balancing the scales and
perhaps the quests should all be altered to show this.  I myself have
already put Kochari on a quest as I was the one that sponsored him.  Again
howver this is not my decision it is your lord Pintir.  

As for the way that they are brought into the knights I offer this to you
all.  I was handed a scroll by Giangelina when I first talked to her of the
knighthood, in it I was told that you must firs become an Acolyte, listening
to the one that sponsers you in all things that you do regarding the
knights, then when you were found well enouph in the knowledge of the
knighthood then you would be set on your own thinking, and woulf thusly be
called an initiate.  After you were found capable by the captain of the
branch that you were to enter you could then become a knight fully.  

This is only my personal thinking, and is just a thing to think on.

Can we do that or not, are we only allowed to be the way we are?

There is a matter which I believe ye most suited at seeking answers to. 
A short time ago the bard known as Sefetah made repeated advances into the
Halls.  With Lady Ilae's blessing, it was decided to see he has the Blood
Mark.  To learn further of the bard, I engaged him, and learned he seeks the
Halls, and stated he has been choosen by Serachel to join the Halls, and
wished to learn of his future home.  I have my doubts as to such, but one
would wish to make certain.  I am certain Lord Serachel would find it a most
unwanted event should Sefetah be slain, if the bard's words are indeed
truth.  For now, I shall leave the bard as he is, Blood Marked, but shall
not seek him.

Great Lord Jolinn,

I write to you this day on the subject of a certain Swordmaster
by the name of Kartinaius. A friend of his came to me nearly a
year ago, now, and asked me to request a tidbit for him. Refusing
to do so, we conversed on the subject of the swordmaster and I
learned that he was having doubts about his uncertain path and that
he was interested in at least learning more of the path of the Light.

Just now, Xor and I have spent many days with him, freeing the souls
of the damned within the Undead Palace. Xor and I got to know this
Kartinaius quite well, and in the process learned about his doubts
and questions about his current path and his path toward the light.

I spoke to him muchly on the subject of Mercy, which seems to be one of
the things he lacks in his life. He claimed that his bag of goods to
pass out to the needy was taken from him by a certain thief, whom he
refused to name. He defeated this thief in battle and, out of kindness,
offered him the return of his things. When the thief attacked once more
did he become questioning to his dedication to mercy and began to lust
only for the end of this (presumable) man.

My question to you, Great Lord Jolinn, is what I should do with him.
I believe that he would make a great ally to the side of the light,
yet he must first learn mercy to all and that this thief, or any other
misguided soul who may bring blade to him in the future, is capable
of change and learning. I want to help him learn, yet words do not 
seem to be enough in this case.


I know that my request is much to ask of You as a simple mortal. I
wish only to further the light and make this land a better place.


Thank you, Lord.

Bayyal, Lord of Destruction, I am Ralilos Reolinusuir.  I have always
wondered what I wanted in life.  I always wanted to see a path.  My only
problem was that I depended on others to gain what I wanted.  I allowed
their weak thoughts to make me think I needed them.  No longer will I do so.
No longer will I allow them to damage me.  

While the void is not made to create destruction, it can be made to do so. 
I wish to serve you to destroy these fools who inhabit this realm.

Lord Akraelyn,

As you may have noticed, all of the ties between Lord
Rulan and Lady Malusmi have become entirely platonic
of late. Speaking with Malusmi earlier today, she 
mentioned that she felt much more comfortable around her
brother-in-guild, and that they were getting along quite
well as a result.

A new issue presents itself here, though, in the burgeoning
romance between Lord Rulan and the Lady Aeli. The two seem
quite comfortable around each other, and seem to be very
at ease with the place in which this puts them. I see little
reason to concern in this matter, though, for their relationship
does not hold the same strain that that of Lord Rulan and
Lady Malusmi once had.

Unless you offer me anything further, Lord Akraelyn, consider
your charge to me fulfilled.

Your Sister-in-guild and -Championship.
Pfusch.

After a recent strike from Rulan, Rihyial, Ralisaren, and Pfusch upon the
Halls, I have reconsidered the effectiveness of the intended goal.  In my
eyes, Rulan's words cannot be trusted further.  I have set my servants upon
him, and the others who granted him aid that day.  Should either of ye think
there is a more fitting way to deal with his betrayal of word it is as
always welcome.  Otherwise I shall see his Spirit broken, and be done with
another of the Tower.  

On another passing event worthy of noting, it appears Brachaormaul withdraws
to the northern plains of Ryarl to become a Shaman in his tribe.  However be
wary, for he has returned once already, though his greeting was death from
my servants.  I suspect he will not return again though.  

A final matter of importance is worthy of noting.  A new tool has shown
itself to me, the giant Mharija.  She is of the alatharyan race, though
differs greatly from what one would normally expect from their kind. 
Certainly crude at best, she does however show some signs of intelligence. 
Already her aid has served the Halls well.  She is in part the cause of
Brachaormaul's death, and the defiler Alantranz.  Others also, mainly those
of the Tower.  However, this is not what truly holds interest to me.  It is
her desire to slay any who use the strength of the Spirit sphere, atleast in
part.  It seems her focus rest upon those who learn it as a primary focus. 
Already she is sent for Liend and Ralisaren, time shall tell if she will
prove dedicated to this task.
