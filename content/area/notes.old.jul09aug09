Greetings, My Lady Pfusch,

Forgive me if my manners seem lacking in addressing you.  I am unfamiliar
with the proper....  Etiquette when contacting one of Divine station, such
as yourself.  I am humbly aware of my shortcomings, and hope that they do
not bring me disfavor.  But I digress.  This message is concerning such
matters as you requested I bring to light when they occur.  Several tasks
have you set forth for me to complete, of the first, I was to locate five
sponsors of good heart to vouch for me that my path is yet true, and my
intentions real.  I have found but one thus far, willing to do so.  Of the
second task, which you asked of me to follow the teachings of the Champions,
I have an encounter which may bring to light my willingness to sacrifice all
for the cause of the Light.  It was brought to my attention by a soldier
named Sirical, that several dark hearted souls were laying waste to the
Griffin\@s aerie.  Myself and Sirical joined together to end the slaughter
taking place.  Though outnumbered two to one, we managed to end the life of
one of these wretched souls, at the cost of my own life.  More importantly,
we managed to delay their slayings of the nobel Griffins.  During the course
of my recovery, Sirical managed to Lead another of these foes to her death. 
Once I was well again, we again encountered this hellspawned party, and once
more I fell to their blades.  Yet for a time we drove them away from the
Aerie, and once I had recovered a final time, we joined with two others, and
finally forced our enemies to flee from the Griffin\@s lair entirely.  

Perhaps you wonder why I did this?  Why I, a Shuddeni, would fight for the
Griffins.  I do so because....  I care.  I care that these noble creatures,
not simple beasts, are not meant to be slaughtered like so much cattle.  The
same can be said of any sentient race.  I have forsaken the killing of
innocents, within and without the cities.  I shall protect them, with my
life if need be, for many are those who cannot protect themselves...  And I
do so, in your name.  


Your humblest servant,

Ahzagthoth

Divine Goddess,

It was some years ago that I first heard of our friend Ahzagthoth, and his
quest to be transformed from the shackled path of his people to a way more
pleasing to the Light.  I did not meet with him directly at the time, but I
met with the templar mage Shalerin, who was assigned by Lord Deshmin to
watch over the actions of Ahzagthoth.  Since the first mention of his name I
have been graced with good feelings about him.  Though my brothers of Light
had doubts about his dedication, I myself was ecstatic with joy at the very
thought that a shuddeni _might_ seek such a transformation.  After meeting
with Shalerin, and after a very inspiration conversation with a young woman
in the establishment \#Nymph\@s Tears,\# I set myself firmly on the path of
aiding Ahzagthoth in his quest any way I could.  

So you see, Goddess, it is my pleasure to send word of my support and my
observance of Ahzagthoth\@s dedication to transgression toward a free spirit.


Thank you.

Subject (OOC) bug with icy prison~
Text
(OOC) Seems that when you quaff out of an icy prison, bugs grow where no
bug has grown before.  Nothing happens right away, oh no.  They lie in wait,
ready to strike when the next prison is created.  When you do make a prison
after having quaffed out of another one, everything looks alright - at
first.  But when the prison melts, you are magically transported back to
where the first prison was, the one that you (and by you I mean me) quaffed
out of.  Yes, I know, ending a sentence with a preposition and what not, but
personally I think they are good words to end sentences with.  At any rate,
the second part to this bug is that the second prison, though you (me) get
(gets) the \@an icy prison melts away\@ message, if you (I) go back to the
location of the prison, it is still there - apparently, forever. 
Eventually, I fear, all the lands will be filled with prisons of ice.  Which
may not be a bad thing, if you enjoy polar climates.  This has been another
Random Bug Report.  Tune in again next week, when maybe I will have had less
sugar!

Lords Iandir and Rveyelhi,

I have conceived over this last decade an idea I feel is ready to present to
both of You.  

I wish to construct a great monument to the Law in a public place, or even
places.  This monument, in my vision a great arch of black-wrought iron,
would be surmounted by spikes.  Atop the spikes would be mounted the skulls
of criminals brought to justice, with plaques below describing their crimes
against Order and Law for all to see and learn from.  Only Guardians could
mount skulls, and pen the plaques far similar to the marking reports that we
currently use.  The skulls would remain for a reasonable length of time, for
example, perhaps a year and a day.  

I believe I have the funds required to construct the physical manifestation
of the monument, if You are both willing to empower it to do as specified,
so that no one but Guardians could mount skulls and so forth.  

Secondly, to Lord Rveyelhi I request this boon: Return me, if you can, to a
more youthful state.  My body has begun the slow process of failing me, and
the reduction in my abilities is felt most keenly.  Even a single decade
would be most appreciated, my Lord.  

Ever your humble Guardian and servant,

Concerning myself, Janror and Eileryiec.  Unbeknownst to myself it seems
its a bug that I can use phoneix fire as a ghost.  At least from the
perspective of Janror and Eileryiec.  I was under the impression that it was
part of the spells functionality and imploded on them both of them putting
them both at my mercy..  Another supposed \@bug\@ as Janror says.  And while
they were both under mercy Eileryiec proceded to drop and sacrifice the
things from my corpse, which, since you can\@t preform many other actions
under mercy I\@d suspect that as possibly being a bug as well, but thats not
the issue here.  I murdered Eileryiec while he was at mercy and he died as
usual But when I tried to murder Janror he fought back as if I had initiated
combat He fled and I reattacked putting him at my mercy again but he
continued to fight (after it said he fell to his knees) until he killed me
(a known bug) One that I told Eileryiec of and which he ignored by taking
from my corpse afterwards.  So..  The issues here are: 

1 If you\@re not supposed to be able to phoenix fire when ghosted.. 
tell me please and fix it.
2 Janror believes it a bug that I can use mercy with a spell like 
implosion, clarification on that matter would also be useful.
3 Eileryiec, even though he believed me to be abusing a bug in the first
place, blatantly disregarded the the known issue of the mercy bug, even
after I told him. But he says its ok since I broke the rules first. 
If I have then I apologize, truely.

I believe I have logs of most everything that transpired and can provide
them if you want to see them. I\@m not so much interested in regaining 
any lost items as I am having these issues clarified and alleged bugs 
fixed. Thanks for your patience and I apologize that problems like this

Hi Iandir,

Here is my design for the Shrine:

An alcove built into the south wall of the Gaald library opens to reveal a
luminescent shrine.  The tall glass pillars around you have been molded into
great hourglasses.  Inside of them, sand endlessly trickles down though the
narrow neck from the upper to lower chamber, though the later is hardly
full.  These magical pillars hold up a ceiling made from the clearest glass,
allowing you to see the sky above.  The floor you stand on depicts a
holographic map of Avendar; the details of which are marvelously in-depth
and intricate.  Set in the center of the shrine is an altar of gray marble,
upon which rests a large opened book with a quill resting in the seam.  A
tranquil silence permeates the room, allowing one to hear their inner most
thoughts.  

Thanks again for all your hard work and time.  I really appreciate it.

Obfuscation is currently bugged.  It allows only one cast of obfuscation

In other words, if I were to cast obfuscation on myself with Jolinn as my

people, however, it\@s when an immortal takes time to interact with them,
regardless of level.  It\@s what got me hooked, and kept me coming back, in
the form of a rather interesting conversation with my level 10 with Marlax.

I\@ve mudded off and on for somewhere around 6 years, starting my second
year in high school.  Avendar was my very first mud, and with a couple
slight exceptions, my only mud.  I took an afternoon off once to try out
Carrionfields, because people had mentioned it.  I died to someone right
away, and that was enough for me.  Also, I was an Immortal for a very short
time on a mud one of Avendar\@s former players started up, but that died
shortly after.  I love to roleplay.  It\@s why Jolinn still holds my soul,
despite how many times I\@ve tried to take it back.  I just can\@t get enough
of the wonderful environment Avendar offers for roleplaying.  However, in my
time at Avendar, I feel I\@ve only had a few successful characters.  What I
call a character successful means to me that when I log on that character,
and something happens to evoke an emotion in them, I can reciprocate that,
because when I made the character, I became the character.  Such characters
that I would consider successful by that standard would be Phaelis, Aesai,
Tylia and Aelisa.

The Temple of the Kei Atkuye

First, some background.  Ever since Girikha was awesome enough to run an
event for Aelisa, involving an ancient, buried temple of the Alatharya
beneath the sands of the desert, I\@ve been absolutely infatuated with the
area.  That, coupled with my particular fondness for Egyptian and Persian
archaeology, led me to design an area around those three themes.  I call the
area the Temple of the Kei Atkuye, which is translated to the High Chosen of
the Alatharya.  It is a temple set far south in the desert, to the west of
Ashta Harrud, although inaccessible by normal means, such as walking right
up to it.  My idea for the area is to make it a sort of expedition area, in
which once a party enters; they cannot escape through normal means, such as
Xiganath.  I intend on giving people who learned alatharyan as a language a
little boost through the area, so items such as the ring and others within
will have things written in alatharyan, which show up translated to that
person, much in the same way the writing on the door to the minarets shows
up. 

The temple is the primary meeting place for the leaders of the Alatharya,
called the Kei Atkuye, or the High Chosen.  It was within the temple that
they made the decision to construct the devices to imprison the gods,
although none of the devices were constructed within the temple, so as not
to draw any unnecessary divine attention to it.  This is why the temple was
preserved through the sundering, unlike the other temple.  While serving as
a meeting place, it is also their arcane sanctuary, where they would
research and study.  This is representative of the animated guardians that
protect the place from all, including other Chosen.

The area itself won\@t be announced, like others were via a note, but
rather through a global event.  A ring, the signet of the Kei Atkuye, is
dropped from a mob that is imm-possessed and difficult to slay, but after
doing so, will spawn only at certain times, such as midnight on a certain
ingame day.  When the ring is worn, it shows a vision of an arch set in the
middle of a desert to the wearer.  The ring cannot be dropped, so whoever
picks it up is stuck with it.  Also, it cannot be identified; giving a
message such as your divinatory magics cannot penetrate the ring.  When the
person wearing the ring reaches the arch in the wastes, it pulses, sending
them south to the crimson sands.  In the sands, people can come across the
buried arch by seeing its top, but only the ring can cause the arch to
reveal itself.  From there, the group of no more than 5 (I hate how players
zerg a new area, like what happened with the mines) can go through a 1-way
portal inside.  The entire area will consist of four parts.  There will be a
courtyard, then the grand hall with the rotunda, two towers accessible
through the hall, and then the arcane vault, which will be opened by
obtaining artifacts in the grand hall and in the two towers.

When players enter the portal, they are placed at a second arch, and in
front of them is the temple.  I want to give the feel that the entire area
was preserved in time, standing as it was before the Sundering.  The
exterior of the temple is a lush garden, set in a grand courtyard of pure
white stone.  There are three animated guardians that stand at three points
around a fountain set in the center of the courtyard.  Each guardian
represents two opposing elements of magic, earth and wind, water and fire,
spirit and void.  They will each use spells from both schools, as well as a
spell that combines both, such as the void-wreathed fire cast by the elder
templar.  As far as difficulty goes, I would say each should be a about as
hard as the top end leveling mobs, such as the Siyyad.  As each is slain, it
drops a piece of a stone disc that, when combined, provide a key to the
front door.  Once the disc is assembled, it will allow players to enter the
door into the great hall.

Once inside the door, players are greeted with a slew of mosaics
depicting the Chosen in all their arrogance.  Through a long, arching
hallway, they eventually enter the rotunda, a gigantic dome with a circular
stone inset in the floor.  The inset, called the Stone of Two Moons, can
only be opened by placing two moonstones within the seal, then defeating the
guardian, which will cause it to fall into a circular staircase.  To the
right and left of the rotunda is a pair of hallways that lead players to the
two towers.  The towers were constructed because the Alatharyans believed
that they would be able control the moons with them.  Thusly, the eastern
tower is the tower of Telianthis, and the western tower that of Nimiel.
Lesser guardians patrol each level of the towers, which are filled with
living spaces for the Kei Atkuye.  Once players reach the upper levels of
the tower, living spaces are replaced with mechanical devices and arcane
research designed to control each of the moons.  Standing guard over these
devices, as well as the two moonstones, are the Guardians of Telianthis and
Nimiel, powerful constructs crafted in the image of the Chosen themselves.
As far as difficulty goes for these, I would say they should be a good bit
tougher than the top end leveling mobs, though not as powerful as the srryn
elders.  Each would perform special abilities, calling upon their respective
moons for power.  Telianthis, being the brighter and smaller of the two,
would call upon the more beneficial aspects of the moon, such as healing.
Nimiel, being darker in nature, would result in more destructive purposes.

When the two moonstones are placed together in the Stone of Two Moons,
the Guardian will be summoned.  The guardian is a spectral creature, crafted
of pure magic, and survived through the Sundering because it does not exist
until someone tries to access the Arcane Vault.  When first summoned the
Spectral Guardian will not initiate combat, but instead stand there.  The
ring will then pulse for whoever is wearing it, and the Spectral Guardian
will turn to them and ask them what they seek from the Vault, whether it is
power, or knowledge.  Answering power will cause the Spectral Guardian to
use more martial attacks, special combat techniques that deal more physical
damage.  Answering knowledge will cause the Spectral Guardian instead to use
spells, calling upon combinations of the greater elements in the form of
dual-sphere spells.  Once the guardian is defeated, the Stone of Two Moons
will split in a spiral pattern, dropping into a stone stairwell down to the
Arcane Vault.

As players descend into the vault, the first room the encounter is the
council chamber, dominated by states of the Chosen as pillars, holding up a
dome on which a mosaic of the world is inlaid.  Beneath the dome is a great
circular table.  It was at this table that the Kei Atkuye laid out their
plans to steal the Quintessence.  At the head of the table, a skeleton of
one of the Chosen will still sit over the council.  Around the skeleton\@s
neck will be a necklace of tiny crystal beads that, when worn, gives a
person 100% in every language (maybe overpowered, but at least it\@s not
combat).  Descending below the council chamber will enter a small chamber
with two doors.  To the east, the door is marked with the symbol of
Telianthis, and to the west, Nimiel.  If the player answered knowledge, the
ring will pulse, and the door of Telianthis will open.  If power, then the
door of Nimiel will open.

Through the door of Telianthis lies a small library, filled with empty
shelves.  Set in the middle, on a stand, lies one thick tome.  Those who can
understand alatharyan, and those who wear the necklace from the corpse, can
read the tome which describes its use.  Holding the tome grants players 100%
scrolls.  Also, once every real life, a player may instruct the book to
create a scroll of any spell in the game, including greater ones.  The spell
is inscribed on the last page of the book, and then removed to the player\@s
inventory.  Through the door of Nimiel, lies an armor stand with two bracers
set upon it, one etched with Nimiel, one etched with Telianthis.  Wearing
the bracer etched with Nimiel will call forth an unremovable blade into the
player\@s main hand, granting a sword the player automatically gains 100%
with (if a swordmaster with higher percent, does not lower current percent).
Wearing the bracer etched with Telianthis will call into being an
unremovable shield that grants the player 100% shield block.  Entering
either room will cause the ring of the Kei Atkuye to shimmer, and draw
itself into the finger of the person wearing it.  This does two things.
First, it summons a portal which allows exit from the temple, and second, it
gives that person +1 to their max and current primary stat for their class.
This effect cannot happen more than once per character.  

I am, of course, fully open to criticism and suggestions on the area, as
well as any other questions you may have.

Thank you,
Aelisa

Subject Apologies + Suggestion~
Text
As most of you probably know, a few weeks ago, I asked for a special bit
of IMM interaction with a character I had created.  Namely, I asked for her
to be permanantly deafened.  I recieved this after a couple days, and went
about writing a suitable background/description/extended description for
her.  Something I felt would do her justice.  While doing so, I began
thinking about how limiting being permanantly deafened truly is.  

Not so much in that a person cannot hear, which is what my character was
created around, but in the fact that deafness itself hardly does the
condition justice.  Needless to say, I apologize for allowing my interest in
her wane to the point that she was deleted by inactivity.  However, I do
have a suggestion that would pay hommage not only to her role, but allow for
people with similar disabilities in the future to roleplay their roles as
best they can.  I suggest that the way deafness works be changed.  

Currently, when a character is deafened, they are stripped of the ability to
see says, esays, tells, yells, and anything else having to do with sound
(barring the few area-wide echoes, such as eagles crying out in the
mountains, or hearing rustling in Morn).  This is fine, except that it takes
away from a rather large asset to any deaf person: animation.  I, like many
others, put actions into my esays, such as esay \@purses her lips, then
says\@...  Deafen takes away the esay completely, including any actions that
might have been included in the prefix.  What I propose is that instead of
eliminating the entire esay or say, instead blank out the actual part that
is said, replacing it with ...  Or something.  Tells would still be blanked
out, because one does not have a moving mouth with which to make reference,
same with yells.  This change would only affect says and esays, primarily
esay.  I consider it essential for any deaf character to be able to judge
from facial expressions, body language, and so forth how another character
might be feeling.  

Just a small suggestion, and again, I\@m sorry for allowing her to fall to
the wayside.  
-Kristen

To the Guardians,

I am Lialkajmliy Inam, Learned of Earth. I wish to enter your ranks
as Guardian and uphold and enforce the laws in the cities. This
is my formal letter to apply for that great privilege and honor.

Of my background, I will say that I was raised (most unnaturally for
a nefortu) by my own parents. My father worked as a servant of the 
mages at the Glallian School of Earendam, and purchased through his
service a place for me in the school. Being no artist, I have in the
years since my apprenticeship transfered to study under Qirnelvra of
Var Bandor, as I did prove to have ability with the magics of earth.
I have attainted the title of Learned, and have an affinity for the 
orderliness which is represented in that sphere, as Qirnelvra will
attest. 

Of my philosophy, I will say that I have never been one to scoff at 
the law. I have not been a devotee of the religions of law, nor a
zealot regarding city law and its enforcement, nor did I consider
membership in the guardians, until this past year. I had an
enlightening--one could say religious--experience, being assaulted
by the deity Tzajai. Upon reflection of the senselessness of the experience,
I have avowed to strengthen my affinity with orderliness, and to stand
against chaos. I can imagine no better place to do so, than among you. 

I look forward to meeting the representives of the Guardians, and
assisting in the enforcement of law to whatever degree I may. I
aided the city in defending against the Raider\@s pillagers recently,
and trust that this was the humble beginning to a long career in
service to the defense of the order in the cities.

There\@s a bug with final strike that if you can\@t move, no moves/boat,
the thief still gets multiple final strikes.  Every time you sucsessfully
flee the thief gets a final strike but you don\@t move.  This leads to loads

Subject The Scythe of Oblivion~
Text
Short desc- The Scythe of Oblivion

Long desc - 

A scythe carved entirely from bone, scrawled with eldritch runes to be swung
as easily with one hand as with two.  It is a ghastlylooking weapon, and
eminates a sense of pure, unrelenting hatred.  



History - I created the Scythe with Guhl, a human Ranger.  The scythe was
intented to be a sentient weapon whose overwhelming desire was to destroy
fire templars/scholars.  

The background begins with the war of Fire.  During that time, the armies of
fire were burning and systematically destroying the forests of Avendar.  In
order to combat the destruction of all they held dear, the Druids of that
time summoned a mighty dragon to protect the last remnants of their refuge. 
The dragon embodied nature\@s fury.  

The summoning was successful, and the dragon assisted in aiding the
beleagured guardians of the forest.  The cost was great though, for the
dragon fell to the mightiest of Fire templar\@s and Scholars.  

With the emergence of the water templars and scholars though, the armies of
fire were finally defeated and the forests saved.  THe anger of the
surviving Druids and rangers was considerable and bordered on madness.  A
legendary Ranger general was chosen to sacrifice himself so that the Druids
might infuse his spirit into a weapon created from the jawbone of the fallen
dragon.  This weapon would be a force of power against future fire templar\@s
and scholars.  The spirit of the ranger would overwhelm any who took hold of
the Scythe and bend their will to it\@s will.  Death to all who wielded the
power of fire for reckless destruction.  And so the Scythe has passed the
years, finding it\@s way into the hands of one person to another.  In some
cases, the owner was weak of mind and easily controlled.  Sometimes their
strength held off it\@s call and they harnessed it\@s power for their own
means.  Yet one thing is certain, the call may be ignored for a time, but
eventually the spirit would take over, and the hunt would begin anew.  

So, that was basically the idea behind the scythe.  Of course, I planned on
it being only wieldable by Guhl, but umm, that kinda didn\@t work out.

Subject Larask and Ilthinizar LAN Cheaters!~
Text
Malenrion was on and then Ilthinizar showed up.  Ilthinizar was lingering
around town and Malenrion moved in, pk situation immediately realized.  Soon
as the guards yell and Malenrion moves into town Larask shows up as
Ilthinizar is running with his tail between his legs.  Malenrion would have
made quick work out of Ilthinizar so he called upon the powers of his
Guardian roommate Larask.  I don\@t know as it\@s realized that Ty (Larask)
and Shayne (Ilthinizar) are close friends but that\@s not the point.  The
point is that one without any doubt in the world told the other to log in
for the pk situation and upon immediately grouping together were able to
bring down Malenrion.  This behavior is sickening and to not ancknowledge
these actions and take disciplinary action immediately would be a crime to
those have been slain by such obvious cheating.  

These events took place roughly between 8:30pm - 9:20pm EST Monday, November

I write to your dark halls this night to request admittance into your

call my own, no family left among the living.  I have become a shadow of the
man I was meant to be, betrayed by my family and left to wander with only my
hatred and shame.  If the strength of my body can be joined again with a
cause, with a purpose greater then my own then I offer myself and all that I
am capable of to you in the hopes that I may grow to be more then I could
ever be alone.  

I will await for you to return word to me however you may but urge that my
offer be considered promptly as the hold the lawmen and the Champions have
upon this world grows stronger with the absence of an organized resistance.

Greetings,

I am penning for the third time my application to be accepted into the Order
of the Crown.  I know you have read my previous applications, Adralya
informed me of such.  His words to me were he expected great things to come
from me and to stay alive.  My body has grown too frail to serve on the
front line of actively pursuing criminals and to defend the Halls of Law,
forcing me to retire so that I may continue my service to you from the
outside.  It has been over four years, if my memory is correct, since I
spoke to Adrayla, within the year since I sent the second scroll, eleven
since my first scroll, again if my memory is correct.  This is the last
dream I have I would like to accomplish after all of my years of service to
you before my body is unable to house my spirit.  I was told you have been
watching me and I was lead to believe you were pleased with my
accomplishments.  I pray that I hear from you soon regarding my
applications.  

Sincerely,

Guardians:

I apologize for the great delay.  I recall writing the scroll when the crime
actually happened, but apparently did not send it away.  

At any rate, Eyrina and I had just entered the city when the Glallian School
tutors were yelling about Azurik breaking his way into the Earth Guild. 
This was on the 25th of Kyanamir, I believe.  

Shortly afterwards, Liokoparus entered the city.  Shortly followed by plenty
of screams by Azurik as the two fought, and Azurik retreated with wounds,
and even rings of fire on him at times.  

Once again I apologize for my tardiness on this.

Love,

I really could have sworn I wrote that parchment.  At any rate, it is sent
by now.  If Ilosan says I didn\@t send it this time, then it isn\@t my fault
this time.  When you left, Zaht was going through the ceremony I believe. 
The vigil, and then he talked about Alhaia and the other champions
performing a ritual of some sort.  I am not entirely surprised to see him as
a Champion, feelings of most of them aside.  

He claims Eseic is more serious to him than us.  It is possible, I suppose. 
Eseic is so random I\@m sure he has a malicious side somewhere.  

I love and miss you, I am saddened that I might not be able to see you this
month.  I will not be able to stay as late as I did last month, but I do
have a few days.  I love you so much, and I cannot wait until we are wed
finally.  Did we ever decide on actual rings again?  I cannot recall.  I

keep away long enough just to catch a glimpse of your beautiful self.

Lady Calaera,

Since I was old enough I have been your humble follower, your servant.  I
have always endeavored to strike out at evil where ever I found it and in
whatever form it may choose to take.  I have strived to always speak the
truth be it through word or action, as the smallest hint of deception would
give root to evil.  I will admit though, to having trouble being kind to
others in the past during an occasion or two.  I have found that some that
are supposed to be beacons of light to be cowardly or greedy at times. 
These were people that I expected more from, examples of what is moral and
good.  I fear the warrior blood of the Ryarl runs quite hot at times and I
met these people with contempt when my disappointment got the better of me,
despite their poor actions.  I realize now this was a mistake and that even
as I let my temper get the better of me I give darkness an opportunity to
take hold on my heart.  

I feel I have overcome this shortfall and am ready to serve you fully, Lady
Calaera.  If you will have me, I wish to take on the mantle of
responsibility and hardship that your mark holds.  I feel I can hold the
light steadfast where it waivers.

This human attacked Sarithis in front of me in center square in Var
Bandor at 4:30 in the morning on the 23rd of The Sundering.  

I also witnessed Sarithis attack Kagun and then Kagun attack Sarithis
throughout the streets of Var Bandor too many times to doctument the exact
times throughout the 23rd and 24th of The sundering.  Kagun eventually
killed Sarithis and then the guards.

actual ability to fake such a thing, I am unsure, as I have thought of him
as a fool for quite some time now.  It should also be noted that Azurik and
Seishor attacked and slew Zaht, and Eyrina was then attacked as she
attempted to resurrect him in Earendam.  Giatre can stand as a witness for
the attack on Eyrina, but I would suggest questioning them both as to the

My wife,

I am sorry that I made you worry by not writing, love.  I was exhausted when
I finally crawled into bed.  We remained relatively safe.  Azurik gave me a
chase for awhile Zaht gathered the rest of his things.  Oyliun woke up, as
did Eseic.  Unfortunately, Oyliun went to rest shortly after when he learned
that the Guardian vault had been raided(I\@ll give you one guess who did it).
Zaht and I parted for rest shortly after Oyliun did.  We were tired, and not
much battling had gone on.  

I love you so much, and am terribly sorry for making you worry unnecessarily
by not writing.  I woke up 4 days ago, but was still very tired and ended up
passing back out almost immediately.  I hope I see you soon, love..  I\@m
already missing you to a great degree.  

Your loving husband,

A gentleman by the name of Azurik saw fit to attack me

He again, after some heated words between himself and myself
attacked me at the Tower. Ill-thought plans on my part rewarded
me with being waylayed and thieved from. The pack has been returned
but the Staff of the Geomancer likely won\@t be. I, of course,
would like the Staff\@s return.


I\@d also appreciate it greatly if all interested in showing

My love,

I miss you horribly.  I had to fend off Azurik, who really, can\@t kill me. 
However, it is more than annoying to have lose my possessions and replace
potions after every fight.  I shudder to think how a fight would go if
another were to join on his side.  

Liokoparus is upset that he was marked.  I admitted to him that it was I who
sent in a scroll, stating I heard the yells.  

Egh, things got bustling for me for a few hours there.  Kagun is upset at
Jophraem.  He claims Jophraem stood over his corpse when eseic killed him,
and accepted the sword Eseic took from it.  Somehow, Seishor has lain claim
to Thethtil and the claw of Kzroth.  Disturbing to see, as last I had heard
Oyliun had wanted to entrust me with it after Alhaia excorsized it.  

Other than these troubling thoughts, the month has been quiet..  Well,
Azurik was a pest, but I\@m starting to find that the standard.  

I love you so much, and miss you more and more every passing day.  I hope
you can sneak away, if only for a few hours to catch a glimpse of each
other.  

I love you greatly, and wish I could see you soon.  

Your loving husband.  

P.  S.  Jophraem says he has been feeling much better, and his stamina has
greatly increased.  As well as \#episodes\# decreasing.

I feel like I have betrayed you, Olyiun, everyone.  For a brief moment I
held Thethtil...  And I returned it to Seishor so he could continue his
training with the blade.  I could not bear to make off with the blade,
sacrificing our lives, my frail body over such a thing that can easily be
retrieved and recaptured again.  My heart grieves with my actions, but I
felt that I had no choice.  



I miss you greatly and feel bad that I could not leave to be with you for
our first anniversary.  Each moment I was away from you, my heart grew
fonder for you, loving you more and more with each passing hour.  I look
forward to our reunion and being in your arms again, like our first time in

I woke within the halls to find that the Golem along with nearly every

Seishor, Ugnestron all stood in formation together within the Square at the
Center of town.  Ugnestron quickly left town, headed down the Dantaron
river.  I located two stones of power in the Raiders Storage Pit, three
within the Coven\@s halls, and Ugnestron was carrying one and denied to even
know what it was, let alone that he was carrying it.  

So, my question is this: If I have very little doubt that they Raideded the

around the Stone of Power no more then a few seconds after the vault was

I will be departing again here after I finish this note.  I wanted to see
you on our anniversary, and am sorry that I did not return quick enough.  I
should not be gone more than a day, maybe two at most.

I have all of your things minus 2 things: Your gown which apparently
Iskadar will not give back until after Goglemayss wears it to defeat the
Leviathan.  Odd, and rather funny while at the same time annoying, but he
has promised to return it.  The Staff of Belerin I cannot find, and Iskadar
claims he cannot sense it.  I am not sure how much to trust his word, or
Seishor\@s, but they\@ve returned everything else I think.  

I assume your mind was not entirely focused..  I couldn\@t find your ghost,
and you made no effort to reclaim your things as far as I knew..  And if
they are returning everything, I highly doubt they did it.  I wish you would
snap out of it and awaken, I am not sure what to be thinking and am worried
about you greatly.  Get a hold of me as soon as you can, love of my life.  I
