Greetings, My Lady Pfusch,

Forgive me if my manners seem lacking in addressing you.  I am unfamiliar
with the proper....  Etiquette when contacting one of Divine station, such
as yourself.  I am humbly aware of my shortcomings, and hope that they do
not bring me disfavor.  But I digress.  This message is concerning such
matters as you requested I bring to light when they occur.  Several tasks
have you set forth for me to complete, of the first, I was to locate five
sponsors of good heart to vouch for me that my path is yet true, and my
intentions real.  I have found but one thus far, willing to do so.  Of the
second task, which you asked of me to follow the teachings of the Champions,
I have an encounter which may bring to light my willingness to sacrifice all
for the cause of the Light.  It was brought to my attention by a soldier
named Sirical, that several dark hearted souls were laying waste to the
Griffin\@s aerie.  Myself and Sirical joined together to end the slaughter
taking place.  Though outnumbered two to one, we managed to end the life of
one of these wretched souls, at the cost of my own life.  More importantly,
we managed to delay their slayings of the nobel Griffins.  During the course
of my recovery, Sirical managed to Lead another of these foes to her death. 
Once I was well again, we again encountered this hellspawned party, and once
more I fell to their blades.  Yet for a time we drove them away from the
Aerie, and once I had recovered a final time, we joined with two others, and
finally forced our enemies to flee from the Griffin\@s lair entirely.  

Perhaps you wonder why I did this?  Why I, a Shuddeni, would fight for the
Griffins.  I do so because....  I care.  I care that these noble creatures,
not simple beasts, are not meant to be slaughtered like so much cattle.  The
same can be said of any sentient race.  I have forsaken the killing of
innocents, within and without the cities.  I shall protect them, with my
life if need be, for many are those who cannot protect themselves...  And I
do so, in your name.  


Your humblest servant,

Ahzagthoth

Divine Goddess,

It was some years ago that I first heard of our friend Ahzagthoth, and his
quest to be transformed from the shackled path of his people to a way more
pleasing to the Light.  I did not meet with him directly at the time, but I
met with the templar mage Shalerin, who was assigned by Lord Deshmin to
watch over the actions of Ahzagthoth.  Since the first mention of his name I
have been graced with good feelings about him.  Though my brothers of Light
had doubts about his dedication, I myself was ecstatic with joy at the very
thought that a shuddeni _might_ seek such a transformation.  After meeting
with Shalerin, and after a very inspiration conversation with a young woman
in the establishment \#Nymph\@s Tears,\# I set myself firmly on the path of
aiding Ahzagthoth in his quest any way I could.  

So you see, Goddess, it is my pleasure to send word of my support and my
observance of Ahzagthoth\@s dedication to transgression toward a free spirit.


Thank you.

Subject (OOC) Buggy heatsink + calm/subdue~
Text
Travelling in Yithoul, just so happened I cast heatsink on a shud void
temp mob.  My groupmate had the cloak of the river, and it subdued the temp
during the fight.  This led to massive screenfuls of the templar being
pitifulled and patheticked to death by his/her freezing weapon...  In
addition to the fact that a subdued person should not be attacking, this
occurred at a much faster rate than normal combat would have allowed.  While
rather humorous, I am fairly certain this is a minor bug.

Subject (OOC) bug with icy prison~
Text
(OOC) Seems that when you quaff out of an icy prison, bugs grow where no
bug has grown before.  Nothing happens right away, oh no.  They lie in wait,
ready to strike when the next prison is created.  When you do make a prison
after having quaffed out of another one, everything looks alright - at
first.  But when the prison melts, you are magically transported back to
where the first prison was, the one that you (and by you I mean me) quaffed
out of.  Yes, I know, ending a sentence with a preposition and what not, but
personally I think they are good words to end sentences with.  At any rate,
the second part to this bug is that the second prison, though you (me) get
(gets) the \@an icy prison melts away\@ message, if you (I) go back to the
location of the prison, it is still there - apparently, forever. 
Eventually, I fear, all the lands will be filled with prisons of ice.  Which
may not be a bad thing, if you enjoy polar climates.  This has been another
Random Bug Report.  Tune in again next week, when maybe I will have had less
sugar!

glimpsed as they patrol above.  Along the bottom of the wall, defensive
runes and wards are set in the stone.  The ledge extends northward and

this point, through the well-guarded gatehouse.  The angular peak of the

templars to cast their spells on any attackers below.  The battlements
continue to the north and south, and drop off just before the gate to the

There is a tree in a rugged forest, northeast of var bandor.  Thru a

kills me one tick later.  I come back as a ghost, but am still poisoned.  I

loot it fast enough, recall to the altar, try and heal poison.  But the

then Alfalabrim walks in and kills me, loots me like he has done so many

Subject A request for boon, and an idea for consideration~
Text
Lords Iandir and Rveyelhi,

I have conceived over this last decade an idea I feel is ready to present to
both of You.  

I wish to construct a great monument to the Law in a public place, or even
places.  This monument, in my vision a great arch of black-wrought iron,
would be surmounted by spikes.  Atop the spikes would be mounted the skulls
of criminals brought to justice, with plaques below describing their crimes
against Order and Law for all to see and learn from.  Only Guardians could
mount skulls, and pen the plaques far similar to the marking reports that we
currently use.  The skulls would remain for a reasonable length of time, for
example, perhaps a year and a day.  

I believe I have the funds required to construct the physical manifestation
of the monument, if You are both willing to empower it to do as specified,
so that no one but Guardians could mount skulls and so forth.  

Secondly, to Lord Rveyelhi I request this boon: Return me, if you can, to a
more youthful state.  My body has begun the slow process of failing me, and
the reduction in my abilities is felt most keenly.  Even a single decade
would be most appreciated, my Lord.  

Ever your humble Guardian and servant,

Kiiran Merithos, Senior Guardian and Soldier of the Crown

We took their items, but were called away from the realms. Upon my return, our storeroom has been cleaned out. I had taken a few things before we left, and now they are in the vault. This attack will not stand. I write this to inform you of the si

Text
I was involved in a fight with the psionicist Gahnak.  I had phoenix fire
active and was counting on it to let me get my spells through his lag. 
However once I dropped to 1hp he could hold me at mercy and did so until
till the spell faded and he killed me.  I understand the logistics of mercy
being able to do this, mercy kicks in before you technically die.  This
however really cuts back on the effectiveness of the Fire Scholar.  I would
suggest that it be possible for the victim to commit suicide and release
himself from mercy then letting phoenix fire take effect.  As it stands the
mercy command renders the most powerful spell in the fire sphere useless,
something really should be changed.  

Thank you for your time and I apologize for the typo in the fourth line and
any others you may find.  Please let me know if you believe this is legal
and that it shouldn\@t be changed, I would like to hear the reasoning.

First I state to you all my apologies on such a delay with this report, I
have been detained in return to my duties.  

Now this war has been growing with the Champions of Aramril and the
followers of Jolinn.  They fell the Halls of Law are corrupted with Biezkul,
and myself.  I believe it was spoken as \# our dark hearts\#.  Yet I find this
funny for we do not running around the lands of Avendar slaying innocent
folk, unlike these Jolinn children.  Yet we protect those no matter the
shade of their heart.  It is the followers of this Chaotic house and Lord it
would seem that are the ones corrupted with hatred and care little for peace
and innocence.  They will slay whomever in the name of the light.  

But as for this most recent war those that were involved were as follows:

Riolan: An Aelin templar of water and member to the Aramril tower, this man
has begun so many wars and raids to our halls I do not have the fingers to
count them all.  

Angnedon: This human bard feels he is the voice of Jolinn, a fool that will
aid anyone who battles the Order.  

Oxellelie: A human scholar that practices fully the magic\@s of air, he also
aids the tower and those of the light.  

Delas: A Champion wannabe, an Aelin templar of spirit wishes to fight with
words and compassion as he so declares but will fight for the light no
matter the details.  

Jalaer: Another templar of spirit, as well of Aelin blood.  This one stands
by Jolinn, yet strikes and acts like a Raider would.  

Tiris: A human Knight that believes he is warrior.  This fool just seeks
balance within the realms and will aid any who fall off scale.  

Krageor: This giant barbarian has a pure hatred to the order and Iandir\@s
ways.  He would not hesitate to slay a Guardian and nor should we to him.  

Again I do apologize for the tardiness of my report, I hope this aids all of
the Order in our mission to uphold the laws of our Lord Iandir.  Any by
Rveyelhi\@s guidance I shall strike down those that bring chaos to our order.

Dear Guardians of Avendar,

at the Center Square. After he died, I witnessed Xaine, who I assumed not to 
be deputized nor authorized to loot from a criminal corpse, take a barbed
javelin of decaying oak. He then imbued a manevolent evil to the javelin and
handed it back to the slain criminal, Sethiss. It is my understanding that

I am saddened to note that within just a few days of drawing up the

to run amuck?  

For my part, in light of his most recent nefarious deeds and those which
fill his past with evil, I hold that the truce does not apply to the Knight
Kukir.  If the Knights feel it must be everyone or no one, then with a heavy
heart I will be forced to say no one, for I -cannot- stand by while these

Text
Greetings again,

By the request of Lady Lilisa, I have composed a song that I feel embodies
the essence of the Coven.  While contemplating this piece, I was forced to
strip the..  Ambitions of your Halls down to their grandest purpose, which I
feel is the pursuit of knowledge.  I believe this concept is stressed in the
song, as is my desire for said knowledge.  I hope you all enjoy.  

===========================================================================

Past marvelous courtyards of blackened stone,
Down aged walkways where echoes moan,
Are ancient Halls of which few know:
The Coven of the Shunned, set far below.

A child\@s scream is no strange sound,
For here virgin blood does abound.
Since age does taint the natural wine,
A child\@s blood\@s far more divine.

And such a sight as Demonkind,
Ripping bodies clear in twine,
The Covenites have seen before,
And very well may see once more.

Forbidden secrets time has buried deep,
The Covenites do diligently seek.
To peek beyond that sacred Veil,
To see just what can be revealed.

Making pacts with Demonkind,
They seek their knowledge to refine.
And in their everlasting task,
In the darkness of it bask.

Ambition spurs them further still:
They gladly carry out the Dark Gods\@ will.
For given them is something grand:
Knowledge, even from Heavenly hands.

And \@gainst ones who would them control,
They rebel against the fitted mold.
Instead they fight with all their might,
Destroying those blinded by the Light.

To reside in Halls such as this,
It is, indeed, my whole-hearted wish.
And so with You I wish to conspire,
For me, I know, You shall Inspire.

===========================================================================

I do hope I hear word from you soon.

For long I have lived in the cities, thinking that there I would find the

though I seem to be able to recall little of it.  After stopping and
resting, my mind seemed to clear a little...  My thoughts run on other
tracks than advancement and equipment.  Soon a vision of my past presented
itself to me, that of a great Wolf spirit.  I know not why I remember it,
nor what it did, but I felt at peace thinking of it.  I realized that my
time in the cities and fortresses had dulled my sense of Nature, had robbed
me of the life I should have led.  

I fear I am not the strongest of warriors, nor the mightiest of mages.  I am
ashamed that I am not even the bravest of adventurers, but even with all my
faults I honestly believe your path to be the True one.  I do not ask you to
accept me into the Pack, for I know I am not strong enough to become one of
your hunters.  But I do ask that you see my heart for what truly lies in it
and know that I follow you, whether or not you think me worthy to be a

This is probably the easiest way to do this.  Alright.  So.  This is not

possibility of applying for Immhood.  Maybe.  Regardless of whether I do or
not, I am building an area (which will be the requisite area if I do apply,
and just a donation if I don\@t).  Said area, with your permission, will be
Gralan\@s Oak.  Without your permission, it will be Mandan.  I have already
been building it - it is about 30 or so rooms big so far.  I cannot promise
it will be your vision of Gralan\@s Oak - rather, it will be mine, with a lot
of your stuff bound up into it.  There will be much different from what you
have said, but several things will be retained - I really liked the customs
you came up with.  So.  I guess I\@m asking, is it alright if I run with your

Subject The Wedding, and a Poem~
Text
* A small parchment is folded into a square. On the outside,
\#To Pikkli\# is written in  smooth, graceful lettering. *
  
Dearest Pik,

In thinking about the wedding, I realized that if we plan a
large and formal ceremony, the chances of us being interrupted
by Guardians are high.  It\@d be a pity to have the ceremony
erupt into chaos, the groom and best man suddenly fighting
for their life--and all the guests becoming outlawed as well
as they help.  I hate to even think about such a scene.

Do you think, that given our circumstances, we should opt
for something small, something quiet?  Perhaps even unannounced?
I think it may be best.  If you don\@t, I quite understand--after
all, we\@ll have only one wedding, and family and friends
should ideally be a part.  Please give it some thought.

You know, though, there is a good deal of romance to the idea
of a secret wedding with outlaws and all--the stories we could
tell when we are older!  And, I must admit, I wouldn\@t mind avoiding
the planning and arranging of a big ceremony.  But most of all,
I should admit that I\@m eager to look at you from over the
pool, and this time promise my love forever--and be your
husband.  Forgive my impatience!
   
To wait and to anticipate your love
After long months or seeming years had passed
Was bitter sweetness, like a mystic trove
Where dazzling, ward-enchanted gems are massed.
I could not touch your hand but in my dream,
Nor see your gentle smile but in my mind,
The ache of missing you a constant theme
Despite the signs that showed our fates aligned.
Together through a spirit-bond of hope
Though distances and sunsets do us part,
The simple magics of the heart are rope
That bind us more than any mystic\@s art.
  I cannot touch my dreams unless with you,
  And so my heart and hopes will remain true.
   
Love you,
Jrihi

Text
Today I have seen clearly one of the multitudes of darkness that has
seeped into the hearts of many and corrupted them without knowing - and that
darkness bears the name of Acceptance.  I have seen the denizens of our once
proud land simply accept the darkness that surrounds them.  Even those who
otherwise are strong of soul still hide behind the words of \#not now\# and
\#what can I do?\#  

Today I walked upon one of the lizard men as he assaulted the good men who
mine the caves within the Brintors.  I took it as my fortune that I had come
just at the time when someone should step forward and defend these simple
folk.  But others, even some that I might have once viewed as strong of
heart did speak words of dissuasion.  The one that illustrates my point the
most were the words of the Archmage Phaela as she stated that she could not
help much, but will simplywaituntil he matured more before she would do
anything against him.  

Now I ask you, Champions of Avendar and of the great cause of salvation -
how could people have become so accepting?  How could people simply accept
the countless lives lost, of the countless widows left behind in the wake of
such a beast, and simply be so accepting?  I speak to you because within the
Champions I have seen true warriors who have not yet bowed to the seductive
call of simple Acceptance.  I speak because to keep silent would be to
indicate futility, and I have too much faith in the joys of life to simply
slip into blind obedience and acceptance.  Perhaps it simply takes more
voices and souls that will speak up against these evils - in order to
vanquish it from those in need.  With that hope I shall end this missive.

Subject Chakkach lore.~
Text
A fiercely interdependent and loyal sect of the ferocious Ryarl packs,
the Chakkach broke off many centuries ago, at the end of the second Kankoran
wars, or, as they prefer to call it, the War of Southern Aggression.  Their
clan political structure, at once highly regimented and highly fluid,
revolves around one Lore-Master and Warrior-Thane, passed on by birth to the
firstborn of every previous leader.  This Thane is backed by a Shaman, who
is designed to take command in times of duress, or when the Thane is
incapacitated.  At any time, the Shaman may be challenged to combat in
contest for his title, making the Shaman\@s position far more martial and far
less shamanic than an outsider would think.  This ensures that the most
prominent and wily warriors have a say in the Clan\@s decisions.  

A Chakkach is forbidden to raise his hand against another Chakkach for -any-
reason, unless done under these codes of Contest.  

The Thane and the Shaman are the only two \@positions\@ of the Chakkach Clan,
and not recognized as leaders in the way of the Southron militaries. 
Rather, their historical position is to guide and channel the emotions of
their Clan, to calm or to arouse when necessary.  Only in times of great
emergency does a Shaman or Thane claim true dominance over the Clan --
historically, it has only happened twice, once during the Spring of Smashing
Ice, and the second time during the Meteor\@s Collision.  

Due to the small and spartan nature of the Chakkachs, as well as their
nomadic roamings at the Top of the World, inbreeding has been a problem
which, in the past, has threatened their very existence.  To allow for this,
Thane Takkarilk many decades ago began sending the younger, more aggressive
males south into the Ryarl plains to search for new blood to mingle with the
Chakkach lineage.  Over the years, the Chakkachs lost the traditional
kankoran clan-based xenophobia, yet gained an inherent distrust for other
species.  

The militant tradition of the Chakkachs also sets them apart from their
Ryarl cousins, for they are considered savage even for kankoran.  Warriors
to the bone, their standards of incorporating worthy kankoran into their
clan has given them the nickname of the Blood Warriors -- the original
meaning of Chakkach.  A curious ceremony, a Chakkach (by blood or birth)
must slice his paw and that of the initiate, pressing and mingling their
blood.  The outsider is then Chakkach by blood, and is then given the right
to wear the Chakkach tartan.  A Chakkach\@s tartan, more important to him or
her than even their fur, is to be worn constantly -- while bathing, hunting,
or making love.  

The pups of the Chakkach clan are raised from birth knowing how to read the
tartan, which is a history of the individual written in wool.  Blood members
are recognized by a dark red stripe running down the centre of their tartan,
while birth members bear a blue swath.  The Shaman, or Lore-Master is told
apart by a curious yellow zigzag.  The Thane wears a bone fetish, pinned in
the manner of a broach, over the heart.  Bone pins are used as fetishes,
tallying the victories over those bound by the corruption of the
stonedwellers .

Text
My Lord Dolgrael,

For the majority of the years I have spent wandering this land, I have been
seeking something to fill the void of my life.  The void that the death of
my family created.  I plunged myself into battle after battle, seeking to
bury the loss of my kin in senseless violence.  

After some time, my rage became a living thing of its own, a madness that
comes to me at times.  Granting me great strength, it also dissolved my
recognition of friend or foe.  I have come to believe that the spirits of my
dead family fuel my fury.  I welcome this strength.  

As I have learned to summon the berserking rage and focus the power it
offers, I have come to realize that the battle has become a part of my life
that cannot be denied.  I have also come to realize that your ways and
teachings, my Lord, are the truest and purest that one who lives for the
battle such as I could ever aspire to.  For this reason, I humbly ask for
your blessing in my endeavours.  

Honor in life and battle are is my goal.  To achieve such things, I also
seek perfection.  While I may never be perfect, I can only hope to perhaps
help forge the Legion into perfection as a force.  A force to be reckoned
with.

Text
Lord Dolgrael,

I would hope that by this time you have at least heard my name in passing as
I have strived to follow your ideals.  Since I was very young I have sought
out and engaged others in battle, with each victory in your name.  From my
victories I have sacrificed several powerful mortal-made weapons to you and
your forge.  My hope is that they would be melded with your workings, and
found useful to the Legion.  My constant battle-seeking has slowed my
training, but it has made me stronger just as your teachings foretell.  

I pen this scroll because I am nearing the highest level of strength and
knowledge within my guild.  So once more I wish to trumpet my desire to join
the Legionnaires.  I believe I am worthy but it is yours and the judgment of
the Legion I seek.  If I err in my principals guide me true, for I find no
purpose or honor in the wallowing of ignorance.  Until my hand can no longer
wield a weapon, I am servant to the Legion.  

Honor in Life. Victory in Battle.

Of this band\@s members, from old to new.

Riolan, Champion covered with fur,
Presence as bothersome as a bur.
Though many days he\@s certainly seen,
This sadly has not quelled his idiocy.

For he believes in the way of the light,
Feeling his path is the only one right.
Just as the others of his kind,
He suffers from a closed mind.

Phaela, mage of Jolinn\@s seas,
Enjoys a lot of company.
I\@ve heard she goes in search to find,
Companions of the male kind.

And yet despite her scandelous ways,
To some she\@ll not give the time of day.
But rather judge them on the spot,
For these ones are part of a \@darksome lot\@.

Chadim, Champion of the Wind,
Very much the same as his kin,
For he, too, displays prejudice,
And, beyond that, is a hypocrite.

Pointing his fingers accusingly,
At those who give others death\@s remedy,
He does not seem to understand,
That the blood of others stains his very own hand.

Amielu, of the killing arts,
Ever generous with deadly darts,
Doesn\@t seem to recognize,
She looks on the world with blinded eyes.

For though Death is her own profession,
She\@s angered when a bard dare mention,
Violent things within his song;
She feels such a thing is terribly wrong.

Jaeri, too, a foolish mage,
Better locked up in a cage,
So that just in case stupidity\@s contagious,
We won\@t end up like this bumbling magus.

Then Angednon, Prince of Bards,
A mouthpiece he is, nothing more.
Spouting tripe left and right,
What\@s worse, tripe he did not write.

He speaks of spreading the \@Good Word\@,
And yet worse words I\@ve never heard.
If only he had half a brain,
Then perhaps his audience he\@d entertain.

From these words you must understand,
The danger posed by this poisonous band.
And like all poisons it must be,
Removed quickly and unmercifully.

Knights of Enaerai I thank you for taking the time to consider this

While I\@ve spoken with many of you personally and some of you know my story
already I think those of you who don\@t should know.  I was raised within
Krilin, my father was a soldier of the guard and my mother a housewife. 
There came a night where the men of Krilin, overstaffed with new recruits,
pushed out into the mountains and drove the hill giants to their stockade
where in an overzealous battle the giants suffered many losses, quite a few
of them children or women.  

Needless to say when the giants retaliated it wasn\@t a pretty sight, my
family was amung the casualties.  

My desire to join your order stems from these events, I came to realize a
need for change.  Since leaving Krilin and enlisting under Aer\@s training in
the guild I have witnessed other events and partaken in events that further
resolve myself to this decision.  Meeting the lawmen and Champions have
shown me just how scary a world dominated by either could be.  

I seem to be drawing this out longer then promised so I\@ll stop here.  I
hope to hear from you in the months to come and look eagerly towards working
together with you.

Hello,

Here is what I plan on sending:

Avendarians,

Guardian Kiiran wishes word sent out to every corner of the land.  He seeks
artwork in the form of a portrait of himself.  He is running a contest,
complete with multiple monetary prizes.  Here are the details:

1.  The portrait must be of Kiiran the Guardsman, well appointed and
    honestly painted.

2.  Several signature items are required to be in the portrait, including:
    a.  Kiiran\@s weapon of choice, the yakra-sajji 
    b.  The God Iandir\@s sigil
    c.  Appropriate armor and/or clothing 
    d.  Further embellishments will be looked upon favorably, to a point

3.  The portraits must be of high quality.  Slapdash and sloppy works 
    will be burned.
    (OOC:  Proper spelling and grammar in the descriptions are a must.)

4.  Prizes to be rewarded are as follows: 
    a.  One grand prize, a purse of 100 platinum pieces, with up to 400
    more depending on the excellence of the winner
    b.  A second place prize of 30 platinum
    c.  A third place prize of 15 platinum
    d.  10 platinum honorable mentions at the discretion of Kiiran

5.  Duration:  The contest will run for a period of five years.  At the 
    end of this duration, six months will be taken for judging and final
    decision.

6.  A final note from Kiiran: \#I don\@t pretend to know how to make art, so
    I won\@t bother telling the artists how to do their jobs.  However, I 
    know good art when I see it.  I want them to understand they\@ve got 
    license in their mediums.\#

7.  OOC:  A picture may be included to provide the \#1000\# word desc.  Of 
    course, these images will give Kiiran a greater ability to judge merit.  
    Such images should be sent to Kiiranmerithos@yahoo.com as a .jpg or .bmp
    file.  Note that creation of a picture -still- requires an ingame desc, so
    Kiiran can ICly consider it.

If you feel yourself capable to answer this call, do not hesitate to begin 
your work.


Please contact me if you have any problems with this.

(OOC: I mostly did this because I can\@t really format the note because of the
positioning of it, so I want to make sure the format looks okay before I send it out.
Let me know if it\@s all kosher.)

Text
Avendarians,

Guardian Kiiran wishes word sent out to every corner of the land.  He seeks
artwork in the form of a portrait of himself.  He is running a contest,
complete with multiple monetary prizes.  Here are the details:

1.  The portrait must be of Kiiran the Guardsman, well appointed and
    honestly painted.

2.  Several signature items are required to be in the portrait, including:
    a.  Kiiran\@s weapon of choice, the yakra-sajji
    b.  The God Iandir\@s sigil
    c.  Appropriate armor and/or clothing
    d.  Further embellishments will be looked upon favorably, to a point

3.  The portraits must be of high quality.  Slapdash and sloppy works
    will be burned.
    (OOC:  Proper spelling and grammar in the descriptions are a must.)

4.  Prizes to be rewarded are as follows:
    a.  One grand prize, a purse of 100 platinum pieces, with up to 400
    more depending on the excellence of the winner
    b.  A second place prize of 30 platinum
    c.  A third place prize of 15 platinum
    d.  10 platinum honorable mentions at the discretion of Kiiran

5.  Duration:  The contest will run for a period of five years.  At the
    end of this duration, six months will be taken for judging and final
    decision.

6.  A final note from Kiiran: \#I don\@t pretend to know how to make art, so
    I won\@t bother telling the artists how to do their jobs.  However, I
    know good art when I see it.  I want them to understand they\@ve got
    license in their mediums.\#

7.  OOC:  A picture may be included to provide the \#1000\# word desc.  Of
    course, these images will give Kiiran a greater ability to judge merit.
    Such images should be sent to Kiiranmerithos@yahoo.com as a .jpg or .bmp
    file.  Note that creation of a picture -still- requires an ingame desc, so
    Kiiran can ICly consider it.

If you feel yourself capable to answer this call, do not hesitate to begin
your work.

As the knights have some in-game power and influence, the last

*A large, heavy card of vellum is here, framed in delicate myrtlewood. 
Subtle watercolor has been used to depict a peaceful scene of many beings in
varying leisurely pastimes.  The figures, painted in faintly shining grey
tones, seem to be alatharyan, but there is something more...  Cultured about
their stances.  A gentle stream flows through a garden, though whether the
garden is artificially planned or natural is unclear.  In the background,
lofty pyramids, tipped with shining crystal, reach into the sky.  Brightly
colored birds perch and flutter about the trees, and some indistinct furry
creatures gambol among the humanoids.  

Many of the silver beings are reading or, from their posture, discursing
relaxedly with one another.  None are clothed, several swimming merrily in
the willow-draped water.  

Overall, the painting shows a relaxing scene of carefree pleasure, the
colors muted and soft, aethestically balanced to seduce the eye along the
gentle lines.  

In the corner, a small signature is inked: \@Pikkli\@.  The frame bears a
simple, carved title: \@Yai\@alya at Play\@.  *

*A heavy card of vellum, several feet wide, is framed with dark
cherrywood, polished smooth.  Strong watercolors have been used to paint an
unsettling scene, the color combinations pointedly off-kilter just enough to
confuse and disorient the eye.  A twisted, nonlinear perspective has been
used, making the entire painting seem....  Twisted, wrenched out of
alignment with reality.  

You see before you the top of a tall, solid pyramid, hefty blocks of hewn
reddish stone as tall as an alatharya stacked to the sky.  The top is flat,
roughly twenty paces square.  Upon it is a great golden Altar, the paint
shimmering magically.  Great arcs of blue-white lightning are flashing from
the radiant crystal orb atop the glowing Altar, a traditional revivalist
symbol of the ancient One Magic.  

A circle of yai\@alya, clad in gleaming robes woven of platinum, gold, and
mei\@tzec, ring the Altar in.  Some heads are bowed in respect, but many more
are lifted heavenward, chins tilted upward in defiant stares.  The
mind-wrenching perspective becomes acutely visible as your eyes follow the
line of sight of the ringed figures, the lines perfectly straight, yet
not-straight.  

The sky, a peaceful blue spotted with light clouds, glows with a soft light
that seems out of place with the rest of the discord central to the
painting.  However, the sky just above the vividly-portrayed orb, energy
almost tangibly crackling through the air around it, becomes a livid, dull
purple, a bank of clouds throbbing with an unhealthy, bruised light born of
an ancient and powerful wrath.  The disturbingly power-laden light is
reflected in the eyes of the circle of the yai\@alya, as the figures seem
tensed, anticipating yet not knowing what doom they have summoned upon
themselves.  

Below and far away, faintly visible in the background, rifts and rents have
begun to radiate outwards from the unseen base of the titanic pyramid.  

A small signature is inked in the corner: \@Pikkli\@.  A simple, carven legend
reads at the bottom of the frame: \@The Vanity of the Yai\@Alya\@.  *

*A heavy vellum card, several feet in diameter, is surrounded by a
circular ebony frame.  Dark, almost viscous watercolor has been used, the
color scheme decidedly abusive.  Color seems almost inverted, shocking pinks
and garish mustardy greens rubbing shoulders with livid violets and
depthless sable.  

All of the paint has been infused with magical light, the brushstrokes still
flowing and ebbing with enchanted motion.  The light is viciously muted,
struggling to shine through the bruised colors which seem to float about the
vellum like the skim of oil on water.  

The painting is savagely indistinct, painted in primitive blocky shapes. 
Two figures are the only fully visible objects in the work, silver-skinned
giant humans tormented by pox and swarms of insects.  Umber and burgundry
sand streaks past, stinging the pair as they struggle away from the ruins of
some awesomely gigantic stone structure, lost in the gloom.  

A small signature is scratched into the paint: \@Pikkli\@.  A small, carven
title on the frame reads: \@The Fall of the Yai\@Alya\@.  *

Subject The Enlightenment.~
Text
Lord Rveyelhi,

Father in blood, patron of sin, I call upon you in order that I might
receive your grace.  Yes, liege, your grace to continue on this narrow road
that has revealed itself to me in the sanguine visions that come to me in
the darkest hours of the night.  By your leave, I would set into motion
plans that have not been attempted for ages past.  

I speak of course, of the inscription and encantation of unions so old as to
be almost entirely forgotten by the minds of mortal creatures.  The rise of
the Lords of Order -- the Lords of Dominion.  For the last two decades, I
have carried out your will as your own crushing fist.  As I have bathed in
the blood of Our enemies, new understanding and order has come into my mind.


My very being has been bombarded with the knowledge of things that I should
know nothing about, but that I do indeed know of.  As this information has
taken form in my mind, so has a new clarity presented itself to me.  In my
visions, I have come to know what might be, and what must be done to assure
such an end.  So again, I ask for your grace.  

I have witnessed as the primal matter was shaped inside the void of
nothingness that was.  How chaos ensued in the creation -- how Lord Iandir\@s
will laced the entity with the same void that was, and is, and will be,
bringing his Order unto the world.  Again, I have witnessed this, and more. 
I saw in my visions the abstraction that began to take shape.  Cities built,
the Lord\@s laws decreed.  Naturally, I revel in this enlightenment.  

As a boy, I escaped the undercity one step ahead of my own execution.  At
the time, I did not understand as I do now.  I did not Know.  But now I can
see that new abstractions can arise.  The new structure to give the order
that existed in the beginning.  My vision is of the expansion of the law\@s
rule to the corner of the worlds.  But more than that -- the exertion of
dominion over the populace.  

As a Guardian of Law, I have watched as we have waxed and waned in the
authority and councils of men.  Our pure cause sometimes preferred by the
fools, and sometimes not.  I have witnessed our own limitations.  Through my
visions, it has been made clear how such can be transcended.  It is for
this, of course, that I ask your grace.  I speak of the configuration of
thrones, and the nine phrases of dominion.  I speak of destruction, and of
creation.  

The alatharyans uttered the phrases from their pyramids -- the pyramids
themselves forming the crests that represented the thirteen great lords of
the void.  Their way was folly, because they did what they dared with minds
that were not perfectly ordered.  And so they failed, and were smited for
their insolence.  At this time, we do not of course have the means to invoke
the configuration as mightily as the alatharyans did -- but it can still be
invoked, in the lesser form.  

Jidriln has begun to see matters in the same light as I, as his mind grows
more ordered with the passing of time, and the spilling of blood.  He has
agreed to join me in this endeavor, if our respective Lords agree to its
doing.  If that be the case, then we would utter the phrases, and begin the
journey that would end in the domination of the world to the purpose of
order.  

We would transcend our forms to become more than dead, and less than living,
but wholly pure in the organized states of our minds.  We would become
golems of law, golems of void.  And then the world would know us, and they
would know the enlightenment of the age that we bring unto them.  So, by
your grace, I would continue upon this path.  

Biezkul Yv\@Piki,
Fist of Rveyelhi,
Guardian Leader of Var Bandor

Subject Chakkach lore.~
Text
A fiercely interdependent and loyal sect of the ferocious Ryarl packs,
the Chakkach broke off many centuries ago, at the end of the second Kankoran
wars, or, as they prefer to call it, the War of Southern Aggression.  Their
clan political structure, at once highly regimented and highly fluid,
revolves around one Lore-Master and Warrior-Thane, passed on by birth to the
firstborn of every previous leader.  This Thane is backed by a Shaman, who
is designed to take command in times of duress, or when the Thane is
incapacitated.  At any time, the Shaman may be challenged to combat in
contest for his title, making the Shaman\@s position far more martial and far
less shamanic than an outsider would think.  This ensures that the most
prominent and wily warriors have a say in the Clan\@s decisions.  

A Chakkach is forbidden to raise his hand against another Chakkach for -any-
reason, unless done under these codes of Contest.  

The Thane and the Shaman are the only two \@positions\@ of the Chakkach Clan,
and not recognized as leaders in the way of the Southron militaries. 
Rather, their historical position is to guide and channel the emotions of
their Clan, to calm or to arouse when necessary.  Only in times of great
emergency does a Shaman or Thane claim true dominance over the Clan --
historically, it has only happened twice, once during the Spring of Smashing
Ice, and the second time during the Meteor\@s Collision.  

Due to the small and spartan nature of the Chakkachs, as well as their
nomadic roamings at the Top of the World, inbreeding has been a problem
which, in the past, has threatened their very existence.  To allow for this,
Thane Takkarilk many decades ago began sending the younger, more aggressive
males south into the Ryarl plains to search for new blood to mingle with the
Chakkach lineage.  Over the years, the Chakkachs lost the traditional
kankoran clan-based xenophobia, yet gained an inherent distrust for other
species.  

The militant tradition of the Chakkachs also sets them apart from their
Ryarl cousins, for they are considered savage even for kankoran.  Warriors
to the bone, their standards of incorporating worthy kankoran into their
clan has given them the nickname of the Blood Warriors -- the original
meaning of Chakkach.  A curious ceremony, a Chakkach (by blood or birth)
must slice his paw and that of the initiate, pressing and mingling their
blood.  The outsider is then Chakkach by blood, and is then given the right
to wear the Chakkach tartan.  A Chakkach\@s tartan, more important to him or
her than even their fur, is to be worn constantly -- while bathing, hunting,
or making love.  

The pups of the Chakkach clan are raised from birth knowing how to read the
tartan, which is a history of the individual written in wool.  Blood members
are recognized by a dark red stripe running down the centre of their tartan,
while birth members bear a blue swath.  The Shaman, or Lore-Master is told
apart by a curious yellow zigzag.  The Thane wears a bone fetish, pinned in
the manner of a broach, over the heart.  Bone pins are used as fetishes,
tallying the victories over those bound by the corruption of the
stonedwellers .

It seems that your initiate Buvohler attacked me without a mark on my head in bandor.
I had entered the city and a guard started fighting me while my groupmate sskilgar, whom was marked was fighting him. So I fled to return not assisting. It was then that Buvohler fought sskilgar and sskilgar fled.
After him fleeing, Buvohler then bashed me, even while I was not marked, nor fighting him or a guard. This is illegal and breaks your rules as I understand them.

Well it seems that the guardians are at it again. I was with Sskilgar and Buvohler attacked the party outside of bandor. Then he bashed me in the city without me having a mark on my head.
He then proceeded to mark me after I bashed him in return when he walked back after fleeing. Countless hours later, he fell in town. Oxelliele was aiding him during this time.
After his death I returned to the fort, where they came for me here to. I slew him at the gates, and Oxelliele got away again. I am informing you of this for you to keep yet again a close eye on the guardians. Balance with you all.

Text
* Involved: Buvohler & Telyrr / Kukir & Sskilgar

* Where: In and out of Var Bandor

* Events: I attacked Sskilgar(marked) with a bolo and he fell to the ground.
Kukir joined us outside of the E.  Gatehouse and shieldbashed Buvohler.  He
fled and returned twice more to do the same by the time I had Sskilgar bound
and had attacked.  Kukir aided him.  I was blinded and rested within the
Beast and Bandit.  After my vision returned, I heard shouts from the E. 
Gatehouse.  It was Kukir\@s voice as he yelled that Buvohler was bashing him.
Kukir was not marked at the time.  I stopped aiding him as I questioned his
practices of the law to attack an unmarked person within the city.  He
enlisted Oxeillele\@s aid and Kukir was marked.  The fight continued in the
temple of Bandor, around the N.  Gatehouse, and the W.  Gatehouse.  It
finally ended when Sskilgar pierced Buvohler\@s vital organs and he fell.  

If you require more information, Merely ask.

God Iandir,

I regret to inform you that it seems that your initiate Buvohler, attacked me without a mark on my head in Bandor. I had entered the city and a guard started fighting me while my groupmate sskilgar, whom was marked fought him.

So I fled to return not assisting by any means. It was then that Buvohler fought sskilgar and made him flee. After sskilgar fleeing, Buvohler then bashed me at the east gates, even while I was not marked nor in the fight.

This is illegal and breaks your rules as I understand them. This note is to inform you of the events and for you to look in to them. Thank you.

Why: Looting a corpse

Where: Var Bandor.  

Witness: Myself, for it was my corpse.  

Notes: I was at the fountain when I was blinded, and then attacked, I did
not see my attackers nor the one blinding me, however Sskilgar was seen, but
he had me cloaked, and I am unsure if just the fact that I saw dust blind me
but not person is enough to mark him.  As for Tachja, I know he attacked me
for the hits that I felt but did not see.  I did not mark him for that but
when I returned he was looting from my corpse.  On a side note to all this I
did mark Najil as I suspected him of the act as he was there in front of me,
but I quickly removed the mark on him as it was wrongly done.  For this I
apoligized to him and to my superior\@s and fellow guardsman.

Subject \#Ignorance is bliss.\#~
Text
As I travel the land of Avendar, I find many people knowingly, though
most times unknowingly following the titled mantra.  Such people are happy
to quickly judge others on their appearance, ethos, or alignment without
ever taking the time to research or analyze the situation.  Victims of
ignorant acts against them are not so simplistic or one- dimensional, and if
the perpetrators could lift up the veil clouding their intentions to see the
complexity of a person, mankind would benefit greatly.  The world must learn
that ignorance is not bliss, but rather a malevolent whirlpool spinning,
confusing, and dragging us down into the depths of ill-fated prejudice. 
Although guardians are not perfect by any means, their actions within town
are a steadfast example of how we might propel ourselves into a more
accepting and pleasant future.  

The first of my observations starts with the induction of Ssillisan into the
guardian ranks.  I heard a big uproar from the masses on how a srryn could
ever become a protector of the law, for srryns are stereotyped as
destructive and having a lack of discretion.  Yet, that is just what it is,
a stereotype.  Those who blindly buy into it find themselves hating
Ssillisan without knowing his true story.  I have not made up my mind on the
whole matter, because I have not had a chance to speak with him on how he
became a guardian.  Yet, my brief encounter with him proved he was very
analytical himself.  It appeared one day he was attacked and killed by a
kankoran in town, then looted by someone.  He suspected the assassin
Ssthinkar, and asked me if I witnessed it, but when I did not, Ssillisan did
not jump to his suspected conclusion but rather went on with his ways. 
There was a silver lining though, for surely he gained the knowledge to be
wary of Ssthinkar, and such knowledge proves useful in the future.  

An instance of ignorance that is seen with ethos is also found upon the law
folk.  The fearsome, and much hated shuddeni guardian, Biezkul, seems to
cause much anger on the behalf of others who then direct their rage against
his companions.  I have heard many who walk the lighted path denounce all
guardians just by association with Biezkul, and I find it appalling.  The
likes of Jidriln and Kiiran are in fact good natured beings and do well in
upholding the law.  When Biezkul is on his Rveyelhi crusade to vanquish
those who are chaotic in nature, an act of ignorance in itself, one will not
find Jidriln nor Kiiran at his side.  To hate by association is flipped yet
equally alarming as believing stereotypes, for you are applying the ideals
of one to some.  Those like Jidriln do not care if someone is chaotic,
lawful, evil, or good, just as long as he or she does not break the laws
while in town.  And even if a law is broken, he must interrogate two
witnesses in order to validate the story before he can act upon it.  The
research that is involved before marking someone as criminal is a small step
in the right direction for everyone to use in making judgments upon others. 


As stated before, guardians are not perfect, and Biezkul proves such.  As a
follower of Rveyelhi, he is sanctioned to hunt down all those who are
chaotic in nature, granted they are outside of town, and put them to rest. 
It is hard to believe that all those who are chaotic cannot and will not
live peacefully within or alongside a civilization.  They may not like it,
but that doesn\@t mean they are actively trying to destroy it.  Not to be
outdone, those chaotic followers of Girikha are willed to hunt down all
guardians.  The Windwolf and her followers believe that all forms of law
prevent the spirit of freedom and impose tyrannical shackles upon all.  Yet,
who is to say that a guardian cannot love the freedom that nature provides
outside the city, and also protect those who reside within?  I have not seen
signs of expansion of the city with my own eyes or the destruction of the
forests by those of the law.  There is a preconceived notion that
civilization and nature cannot co-exist, but can we not turn to the Pack and
see it exist within that?  Even their society has some type of order.  It is
another testament to the guardians that all creatures, evil or good, chaotic
or neutral can reside and be provided and protected by the city.  This
knowledge is out there in front of our very eyes, and yet there are so many
who are shrouded and act in either blind faith or ignorant bias.  

The whirlpool of prejudice spins faster these days, and many are sucked in
as their perceptions are distorted.  To judge and execute without knowledge
is what prevents this great land of Avendar from swimming free into a new
era.  An era that is more conducive for people having conversation and
relationships regardless of race, ethos, and alignment.  There will always
be conflict in the world, and battles must be fought, but destruction
without cause serves no purpose.  It only brings confusion, then revenge,
and most times neither party ever realizes how they plunged into a
continuous drama.  If more people took the initiative and patience to study
things we know, analyze what we gather, and research what is not yet found,
he or she could act without prejudice and set an example for others to
follow.

What I seek is a means to an end.  That means is the title of a Raider of Twilight.  
The end is to acquire that which I want.  Nothing less.  I see something, I take it.  I 
have been over this land, preying on those around me with exquisite hunger.  I 
have become strong, but my hunger has not be satiated.  The things I seek, the 
Raiders of Twilight cannot give me.  But joining your ranks will be a means to 
these things.  Already I hear whispers in my wake, already they watch me.  I want 
them to grovel in fear.  I want to feed on this fear and all that comes with it.  What I 
see I make my own.  And my sights are now set on your House.  I do not come to 
you begging and I do not expect you to simply allow me to walk in.  Give me a 
chance to prove myself and I will show you how my name will be remembered.  
The cities shall tremble at the whisper of my passing.  The walls shall crumble at 
our pillaging.  With the acceptance of me within your ranks I can bring many eager 
young candidates, young men and women who will gladly throw their lot in for the 
power that they shall gather.  I shall spread your name and they will come.  
Together we can overcome the pathetic forces of Law that run rampant on this 
world.  They believe themselves safe within their cities.  Within their laws.  Their 
cities are mine.  Their laws, I shall rewrite.

Subject Dishonor~
Text
I write this scroll to make you aware of the taint one of yours has put
upon you.  I do this, not because I believe in the ways that you require,
but because I believe in the teachings of my Goddess, the Windwolf, with
every ounce of strength within my body, and soul.  This is the very same
reason that Salmik and I have bonded, in the past.  And this is the reason
that I called upon him to resolve the situation at hand.  But no resolution
was offered, as Gahnak, the offender refused even Salmiks resolution.  

The offense, Dolgrael, is so sharply in contrast to your own teachings, that
I think even the reading of this scroll will pain you.  After battles had
raged, me, protecting my brethern who he attacked underhandedly, as my
brother travelled, exploring the realms, and was weakened, we arrived at a
stand-still, each having won, but not completed, two to three attempts at
the others life.  It was here that we decided one more battle was at hand,
even after he had voiced doubt in his own ability to win such a duel, and
offered me escape.  

At the onset of this battle, we made standards, that no one elses magics
would enchant us, as he had been using the aid of a fire scholar and I, the
spells of a water templar.  I stepped west, away from the guards, to wait
for him, and quaffed a potion, which had not been set outside the boundaries
of the battle, and which he had also drank from.  It was here that the
standards were broken.  Gahnak asked Anaelis to provide him spells, and
Anaelis did.  

In the end, I fell.  This does not injure me as much as my loss of respect,
and my complete bafflement at the happenings.  Nor does it harm me as much
as did attempting to relieve these injustices in front of a crowd, who
considered my snivveling, despite that I only sought to do you, Dolgrael,
dignity, by untarnishing the reputation of one who values integrity as I do.


Finally, if you would care to call upon witnesses, you might ask Anaelis,
Kukir, Gathorn or Inthyssn.

As I look back on the time I have spent with you...  I can only think of
the abuse I've suffered.  The doubts cast relentlessly in my direction, the
twisting of my heart in so many hands.  

And I have said to myself, 'no, this doesn't matter, for that I care for
him'.  

And I have looked upon the times I have spent with you, and I think...  Of
how you have treated me.  

Perhaps you do not realize the effects your words would have upon someone
such as myself.  Perhaps it does not occur to you the sheer undermining of
confidence that is implicit in such phrases as 'I could not put you into
that kind of danger'.  The blows you dealt to me with phrases such as 'I
couldn't bear to see you get hurt.  ' 

The sheer lack of respect for anything I might do that rang through those
words.  I would rather you had slapped me.  

Even now, I stand...  Terrified.  Awash in the realization that I -have-
come as far as I have, relying upon you.  And the terror arises in me that I
am not strong enough to stand alone.  

The terror that would never have existed in me, before I had heard such
phrases.  

The condesencion in the phrase you said to me, 'I know you are a fierce
warrior'.  

And I would have said to myself...  'This doesn't matter, for that I care
for him'.  

And I do care for you, for all the pains you have dealt me.  

But I can't throw myself into a fire for forever.  I can't keep doing that
and hope that this time, the fire won't burn.  

I can't keep doing this to myself.  

What am I throwing myself at you for?  To be placed upon a pedestal, turned
once more into some blown-glass doll?  

Throwing myself into anguish to receive more anguish?  I can't do this.  

I don't believe I'll be troubling you further, Raelasu.  

I love you more than anything I've loved in this world, but this sort of
pain...  Is too much.  

But I will always love you.

Girikha,

I have prayed at your shrine, and left this there, in the hopes of my
prayers reaching Your ears.  

I hesitate to seek you in this fashion--I have long been an applicant to the
Champions, seeking to serve alongside them, but only recently have I begun
to think it might be possible for me to fight for you as well without
dishonor.  Rakhrhun Chakkach suggested to me that I seek your favor, despite
my admission that I had sought the Champions out, and I chose to accept the
Loremaster's advice in this matter.  As you doubtless know, the Guardians
have grown corrupt and evil.  Biezkul has claimed repeatedly his intention
to turn Var Bandor into "New Yithoul", and rule the city.  While all cities
are miserable places, one under Biezkul's dominion would be a true horror, a
blight on the face of the world, and a source of darkness that would only
spread into untainted lands.  

Myself, and many others, have fought hard to prevent this occurence--but it
seems we have fought in vain, as one after another we have fallen to the
Guardians and their allies.  Chadim, a wise man and a powerful ally, has
gone into the realm of death forever.  Riolan has grown old, and is rarely
seen outside of the Tower.  Prayers to Jolinn for aid and guidance by his
followers go unanswered, as do messages to the Champions.  

I have never been a follower of the Sapphire Spear, however, and so I turn
my own prayers to you, in the hopes of guidance and aid in the battle
against the Guardians.  

Please, Girikha, hear my prayers, and grant me a sign that I may know that
the path I tread is one that does both of us honor!

Master Yilith,

As I have often frequented your store to peruse your goods, and
know well your prowess in the art of crafting jewelry and other
fineries, I would like to petition you to create a special piece
for me.

I am interested in a pair of spectacles with lenses carved from
ruby-- thinly, of course, as they are more for show than for
actual visual enhancement but still must be seen through-- while
the frame is of some sort of dark metal.  I have a feeling you
may have a suggestion with your skill in workmanship of this
nature.  I would like this piece to have a remedial enchantment, 
a bit like your others, with some nominal improvement to the 
wearer's health and defense against spells.

I am willing to pay handsomely for this piece, and if you find
it sufficient to begin work on it, I would like to discuss how
much you consider appropriate.


Thank you for your time,

Archmage Vaelas Leottan

Hello again, travelers,

Once more I bring you an original composition of mine.  I composed this
piece some years ago, after a request for a more light-hearted tune.  I
decided to write a tune that one could dance to, while still infusing my
artistic style into the composition.  Some of you may have already seen me
perform this piece, although I am sure many have not.  Enjoy, one and all.

Will you go a-prancing today?
Will you dance the night away?

Your mother fell and split her head,
She lost too much blood and now is dead!

Will you go a-prancing today?
Will you dance the night away?

Your father is sick, he cannot be saved,
In a few hours he'll be in his grave!

By enemy forces was struck down!

Your sister went skipping thru Nendor,
Found an Ent's lair and skipped no more!

Will you go a-prancing today?
Will you dance the night away?

I think you'll go a-prancing still,
Dance the night away you will.

For you were the one who pushed your mum,
And you the one who poisoned dad's rum.

And you convinced the boy to enlist,
And deadly directions you gave to your sis.

Will you go a-prancing today?
Will you dance the night away?

* A small parchment is folded into a square. On the outside,
"To the Knights" is written in smooth, graceful lettering. *
   
Knights of Enaerai,
   
If you represent balance in truth, and not just in a skewed
and self-serving fashion, then I would charge you to spread
an equal amount of peace, hope, nurturing, and goodwill
throughout the realm as you do murder, hate, and ill will.
   
If you truly represent balance, I charge you to initiate the
cycles of peace and goodwill that might offset the cycles
of death and revenge that you have created.  
  
If you would be true to balance, for every life you take, I
charge you to shelter, preserve, and nourish a life.  For 
every item you take by force, give another in charity.
    
In this, you may show all whether you are true disciples of 
balance, or as many have come to see you: self-deluding 
thugs, evil masquerading as duty.

Captain, I don't know if I ever told you, but I spent some of my free
time in the city guard working in the armory.  The point of this otherwise
useless information is that I have worked up a set of plans for some
protective gear that you might be interested in.  I doubt Captain Biezkul
would care, but well, I think the rest of us might.  

I propose that we try to find an armorer to build, on contract, goggles for
the guard.  These goggles would have a face of gray-tinted crystal, since
clear crystal might amplify sunlight and blind the wearer on a clear day.  I
propose crystal since it is almost impossible to break with a typical
weapon.  This snugly fitting goggles would protect the guard from assassins'
dust and gladiator thumbs.  I regret that I can think of no conventional
defense against void scholars and their maledictions.  

Captain, if you think you might be able to secure a contract from an armorer
for such goggles, or if you wish me to pursue one on behalf of the Guard,
please let me know.  I will be happy to provide the plans to you.

Lord High Master of Honour:

I must express my deepest questionings for the one who wishes to follow you,
the alatharya named Khel.  While standing at Center Square, speaking with
the Lady of the Knights, he assaulted me with a massive overhead smash.  I
fought back, defending the city as is my duty, and fell.  It is not my
falling that bothers me, though it is hardly a question that I would lose,
but rather that he would choose to attack a mostly naked man in the midst of
a conversation.  

I doubt that this is the form of honour you espouse, nor the art of battle
you would suggest best.  I have fought others who follow your religion well,
in man-to-man duels, sometimes losing, sometimes winning.  Regardless, this
is..  Troubling.  

Do as you will, Lord.  I simply ask that you consider this.

Text
My friend, I hope this missive finds you in good health and sound mind. 
Recently while visiting the spirit palace I came across an old history book.
The book detailed the founding of the spirit tower and some of the trials
the first Arch-mages had known.  For the most part this proved to be a
rather boring read, there is however one section of history that caught my
attention.  During the reign of the fight Arch-mage a group of scholars
splintered off from the traditional guilds and formed what the Spirit mages
called a cult.  This group of scholars called themselves the Maevis'Hra and
theiy used a fusion of fire and void magic in an attempt to bring an eternal
night to Avendar.  Supposedly this group is responsible for bringing the
demon lord Kzroth into the realms, if that is true then they wielded awesome
power indeed.  

I request that you use whatever texts or resources that you have available
to research this group and their quest for power.  You will of course be
reimbursed for your time, when we next meet if you decide to research this

from the knowledge this group may have collected.  If void and fire could be
fused why not other spheres or even the combination of your musical magic
and the arcane.  The possibilities are endless, as is the potential for
power.  

Think about it and let me know, I await your reply and your expertise.

Subject Regarding the Knights~
Text
Events have taken place.  Rather...  Amusing events, I suppose one could
say.  The Knights have split off, two of their members are now Renegade. 
Though, the reasons for each are vastly different.  

Kukir went completely and utterly insane, after Anaelis ordered him to not
attack us.  A Raider in making, if I've ever seen one.  

Raelasu, hm, he left due to faulty leadership within the Knights.  This was
after he returned some of our most precious goods back to us (Biezkul, I do
have your monocle).  He has requested a meeting with me, to 'further discuss
the Law'.  

In the mean time, do not attack any Knight for now. We have a growing animal problem that I want dealt with first. This problem includes Kukir, mind you.

May Order spread over the land under my rule,
Jidriln Chaskalma, Guardian Leader, Knight of the Crown

Raiders,

I, kukir Klarak pen this scroll after much has happened in my life. Once being a Knight of Enaerai, warrior of balance, I have seen many battles. As of late however I have began to lose interest in protecting the balance and have seen the ways of 
the dark side. In my last days as a Knight I began to feel contempt and hatred for the Lady Anaelis, and the guardians of Avendar. It was her lack of courage and aggression which led to my departing the midst of her and her knights. I 
now have a new plan in life, to destroy her work and her knights along side with the bloody thieving guardians. The balance of the world means little to me any more. I have much hatred and anger burning inside me which I wish to release upon them.
. It is for this reason that I wish entrance into the canyon. To bring about the dark days of this realm, suppressing the guardians and Anaelis's cowardly knights to the canyons power. Whether I should have to follow another, or lead the canyon to
power, both I will do willingly. I have slain many guardians in my time, and I never tire of their blood upon my blade. 

Kukir Klarak, Renegade Knight

Dear Corolan,

How have you been?  It's been ever so long since we last spoke at dear
Danrasad's midsummer ball.  

I've been very busy with my guild of late, but, I've gotten married to a
wonderful man named Jrihi!  We wanted to write to you because we saw the
lovely house off the Vorinden road, and we adore it.  Perhaps you might know
the builders?  We were thinking that it might be relatively affordable, as
it's lain empty and dusty for so long, it seems.  

If that's possible, do you think that the land there would support goldfish?
The pond's quite lovely, of course, but I don't know if it's a good habitat
for fish, and I'd like perhaps to be able to meld home when I'm done
practicing with Lydara each day.  

Thank you so much!  Please, let us know if you can contact the original
builders.  

Your friend,
