\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Players now have the ability to purchase and own houses. This option is
only available to players with accounts who have been noted
as active roleplayers. 

To purchase your house, you will need to do the following:

-Find an architect to build your house in a city, and pay the requisite fee.
Note: The average house will cost 1,000,000 copper per room.

-You will be contacted by the immortals once you have paid the required fee.
 At this point, you will be contacted about providing a location, description,
and any additional amenities you would like to purchase for your house.


Your house will appear as an entrance available in the room where it is constructed.

For example, if your house is a wooden cabin, you might see:

A stout wooden cabin is here.

You can enter your house via the ENTER command. 

Ex: Enter Cabin

If you have a problem or question about your house, please address it in a note to IMMORTAL.

Syntax: Destroy <Item>
        Sacrifice <Item> <Optional Deity>

In Avendar, you can remove an item from the game by using the DESTROY or the SACRIFICE command.

DESTROY will destroy an item completely.

SACRIFICE sacrifices an item to a specific deity.

Generally speaking, a sacrifice allows you the chance
to obtain a reward from your deity, often dependent on
the power of the item sacrificed.

Be warned, however, that not all deities are pleased with
inappropriate or unworthy sacrifices, or do not wish to
be disturbed at all. Sacrifices to these deities could
conceivably lead to a dire fate!

You may specify no deity, and receive a chance at
generic (albeit less potent) benefits with your sacrifice.
(Note: this feature will be implemented shortly)

Currently, you may sacrifice items to Jolinn or Enaerai. (More deities
coming very shortly.)

-1 RYSTAIA PEGASUS CHOSEN FREEDOM JOY PASSION CASHMEREWHORE~

Rystaia is a ch'taren god, who helped guild the them
to Avendar in ancient times passed. She stands for the
principles of Joy, Freedom, and Passion, and welcomes worship
from any whose heart leads them to her temples, though
predominantly her followers are good, and of chaotic ethoi.

The followers of Rystaia are known as the Chosen, and
are branded with either the Alabaster Pegasus, Soaring
Pegasus, or for the most dedicated, the Pegasus with
Wings of Light.

FREEDOM
=======
The most important of Rystaia's doctrines is that of
freedom, the ability to live in accordance with one's
heart. Those that are truly free are not enslaved by
their desires, and are untouched by the binding
temptations of greed, anger, or hate.
When one is truly free, only the pure intentions
of the heart will guide thee.

Evil taints and shackles the soul, rendering all who
walk in the darkness enslaved by their petty and cruel
ways. It is the calling of the Chosen of Rystaia
to free all those trapped by their physical and
mental bonds, and to destroy those that would seek
to enslave their fellow creatures. This is done not
with hatred, but with the goal of releasing those of
dark intentions from the prison their hearts have
created. The bonds of fear and darkness are stronger
than steel, and often the only release from them
can be found in the afterlife.

PASSION
=======
When one is free from the grasp of the tempations of
the darkness, one can begin to follow their heart.
That which follows, Passion, comes most naturally.
The Chosen, those that are passionate in life, give
themselves entirely to the moment, never holding back.
To truly embody this ideal, one must never shy from
life, and instead commit one's self fully to that
which they know to be Good.

JOY
===
The third and final principle of the Chosen, Joy, is
that which truly makes life worth living. Those who
truly embody this trait are able to find happiness,
no matter how bleak their outlook may be. To have the
wisdom to appreciate a rose in a battlefield is
difficult, but in the end one of the most precious
gifts of all.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Rveyelhi, a once-mortal shuddeni Guardian, is a servitor
deity of Iandir. He currently oversees the house of
Guardian in Iandir's stead while the greater deity
tends to other planes and worlds.  

A brutally efficient guardsman in mortality, Rveyelhi
endorses a similarly strict manner of dealing with
criminals.  Followers of Rveyelhi believe that those
who would break the law are little more than rabid
animals clawing at the tapestry of civilization. These
beasts are to be put down, lest their scratching
unweave it.  Law breakers, as well as anyone else who
would bring chaos to the world, are to be dealt with
by any means within the bounds of law and with no mercy.
  
Followers of Rveyelhi found worthy are branded with the 
Sigil of the Black Staff.

|       Enaerai, Lady of Balance                                      |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

    Enaerai is among the deities who came to Avendar after the three great
powers had wrought the world.  Finding the balance and harmony of their
creation to be precious, and believing powers of fate to be in play that
supersede even the creators, she works to maintain the balance among the
many conflicting forces in the world.  Her efforts take place primarily in
the immortal realms, and she does not often directly interact with mortals. 

    In times past, dedicants to Enaerai, whose hearts were true in balance and
neutrality, organized themselves into the Order of the Knights of Enaerai.
The knighthood they founded continues, working in Enaerai's name by her
blessing, to preserve the balance among mortals.

|  The Knights of Enaerai                                             |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The Order of the Knights of Enaerai

The Knights of Enaerai seek to uphold the balance in Avendar.  By persuasion
or by force, and acting as a unified military body, the Knights are ever
vigilant that no extreme influence disrupts the equilibrium and natural
balance as created when the three great powers first brought Avendar into
being.  

The Knights revere Enaerai, who is held as their guiding deity of balance,
though no active worship is required throughout the Order.  They also
observe Mettenday, the first calendar day of every month on the standard
Avendarian calendar, as a day of rest, recuperation, and assembly.  No
efforts to actively enforce balance are made by the Knights on Mettenday. 
The Knights are based in the city of Earendam, in a compound adjunct to the
Temple of Enaerai.  

REQUIREMENTS OF KNIGHTHOOD

Adventurers who are neutral in both alignment and ethos may become Knights
of Enaerai.  However, scholars who practice the greater spells of spirit or
void, and templars of those spheres, may not seek entrance to the
Knighthood.  To join the Knights of Enaerai, seek out members of the order
and petition them for entrance.  Knights may be recognized by the symbol of
Enaerai--the eye within a triangle.  

THE OFFICES OF KNIGHTHOOD

The organization of the Knighthood is straightforward, run with the
efficiency and manner one would expect of a military order.  Knights heed
the directions of their superiors without question, sacrificing life and
even soul to the cause.  

The Knight Lord leads the Knights.  He or she is the highest officer and
supreme commander of the Knights, maintaining the order of the knighthood
and directing them in actions to right the balance.  

There are up to three captains of the Knights, who vote for the new Lord
should the office be absent.  Each is also given the leadership of the Mett,
Idris, or Ilthar divisions of the Knights.  

The Captain of Mett is charged with subterfuge, spying, scouting, and
providing necessary reconnaissance, as well as leading the rogue component
and other miscellaneous forces of the Knight body.  

The Captain of Idris pools and compiles knowledge regarding adventurers in
the land and their effects on the balance, and the balance between houses,
as well as leading the magical or scholarly forces of the Knight body.  

The Captain of Ilthar is charged with being the second, under the Knight
Lord, to direct in battle, to administer punishment of final death to
renegade Knights who have broaken their oaths of Knighthood, and to lead the
warrior forces of the Knight body.

-1 ACCOUNTS ACCOUNT 'NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|               Accounts                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Avendar features an ACCOUNT system for its players.

Basically, this means that rather than using individual characters,
a player has the option of creating an account to manage his or
her characters from, and to establish a reputation with.

Players create, or add new characters to an existing account,
only during character creation, AND AT NO OTHER TIME.

This means: If you want a character to be a part of your account,
this must be done at creation.


Your account's name is the name of the first character you ever
create with an account.

To use your account, simply log in with your account's name and
password.

If you are playing from a banned site, you will require an account
to play.

Each player is allowed precisely (1) account. Attempting to create
multiple accounts is considered a violation of the rules, and doing
so with the purpose of creating multiple identities for yourself is
a bannable offense. 

Accounts are voluntary, but people who maintain an account can
establish a reputation with the mortals for good roleplaying, and
will be rewarded accordingly.

We highly encourage you to play your characters from an account,
as it allows immortals to target and reward good roleplayers.
Expect more benefits from accounts as time goes on.

The following are mandatory rules for anyone using accounts:

I. Only one account per person is allowed. Attempting to
create multiple accounts is considered a violation of the
rules.

II. Do not give your account password to any other player, or
attempt to acquire the password of another player.

III. Your account is an out of character relationship between your
various characters. It is not an excuse for multi-charring!

Writing is done in the language the player is currently speaking.
Players must be sitting or resting to have the concentration
to write.

Syntax: Cast 'Abominable Rune'

This spell allows void scholars to place and dark and fearful rune in
a given location. Those other than the void scholar who encounter
the rune are stricken with powerful fear, and, in some cases,
hysteria.

~

Syntax: Cast 'Desecration'

This spell corrupts and defiles the immediate vicinity of a void
scholar, improving the practicing of void scholars and hampering
the practice of spirit magic in the area. Such is the power of
of the spell that positively aligned beings, such as avatars
will find travel in desecrated places difficult.

-1 'DEMON SUMMON' 'DEMON SUMMONING' 'LESSER DEMON SUMMON' 'GREATER DEMON SUMMON' 'GREATER DEMON'~

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Lesser Demon Summon'
        Cast 'Demon Summon'
        Cast 'Greater Demon Summon'

Demonic conjuration is the power which defines the discipline of
void magic. Every void scholar who is more than a dabbler in the Art
learns how to conjure at least a few lesser demons, and the most
powerful scholars can bring forth demon lords so powerful that even
kings tremble at their passing.

Of course, binding the deceptive, treacherous, and willful denizens
of the Void is not a trivial or even straightforward task. Each and
every demon is bound by a characteristic inscription, written
with a particular material, conjured with one of the three rituals,
and has a specific price.

Inscriptions (See help INSCRIBE) are diabolical symbols which void
scholars must acquire and burn into their soul. Once learned, the void
scholar may INSCRIBE the symbol in a location, in preparation for
summoning a demon.

Materials (see help MATERIALS) are what symbols are inscribed in.
They are typically symbolic in nature, and vary greatly.

The rituals are the three spells of demon summoning. More powerful
demons are accessed through increasingly powerful spells, but a given
demon will only respond to a particular ritual (i.e., if lesser demon summon produces a certain demon in conjunction with a given symbol and material, it is not the case that greater demon summoning would produce the same demon.)

Finally, every demon will demand a price of the caster. The more
powerful the demon, generally, the more potent the price. The wise
scholar is encouraged to determine what the price might be before
summoning a demon, as the failure to be may be very dire indeed.

So, to summarize: A given demon is summoned by the conjunction of:
-A mystical symbol
-A material in which the symbol will be inscribed
-A particular ritual (lesser, normal, or greater demon summon)

Void scholars who study and are well-traveled will find clues as to
what demons require in the way of prices, symbols, materials, and
rituals. 

WARNING: It is not advised that void scholars randomly experiment
with given combinations of material, symbol, and ritual -- there
can be extremely dire consequences to certain conjunctions!

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Demonic Control' <Bound Demon>

This spell is used by void scholars to renew their control over
bound demons. Such creatures will eventually slip their bonds
(there will be visible signs of this struggle immediately before
they break free and assault their master!). When cast, the
spell will renew the bond for another time interval. Unfortunately,
each casting of this spell requires geometrically more magical
energy, and at this point the void scholar will be forced to
banish the demon or face their ire.
~
-1 'RITE OF KAAGN'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|         Rite of Kaagn                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Cast 'Rite of Kaagn' <Target PC>

The Rite of Kaagn is cast by void scholars who wish to curse other
adventurers. Unlike other curses, the void scholar need not cast
the curse physically on their target. Instead, the curse is invoked
while holding an item once owned by the intended victim.

-1 INSCRIBE SYMBOLS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|            Inscribe                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Inscribe <Mystical Figure> <Material>
        Inscribe

Both void templars and scholars can inscribe mystic figures in order
to aid them in the practice of their craft. Certain spells require 
these mystical figures be present, and certain materials are needed
to inscribe them. 

There are certain basic symbols, which every void scholar and templar
knows:

Figure Type:                              * Material Needed:

Circle of Protection                        Silver dust

Trigon of Binding                           Charcoal

Pentagram of Summoning                      Powdered Bone

(These materials are for the void templar class, who have limited
use of symbols.)

Circles of Protection provide resistance to summoning and other 
extraworldly forms of transportation.

Trigons of binding are used in rituals to bind demons into items.

Penatagrams of summoning are used for the basic summoning ritual.


There are other, more complicated symbols in addition to these,
which void scholars use in the summoning and binding of demons.
These symbols are not available to starting void scholars, and must
be found in Avendar, often requiring that the void scholar study
the symbols.

Once learned, scholars can access which symbols they know through
the use of the inscribe command without an argument.

Different demons are summoned by different symbols, so knowing
a wide variety of symbols ensures a diversity of options to
the void scholar.

The materials for mystic figures are typically available in larger
towns, either from guildmasters or magic shops. Certain rarer
ingredients will require more effort to find (rare herbs, etc.)

Materials are the ingredients scholars and templars use in
inscribing mystical symbols. Common materials are generally
available in guilds or apothecaries, while other, more exotic
materials might require more effort.

Common ingredients include charcoal, powdered bone, silver dust, or salt.

Less common ingredients may include the blood of various creatures
(including the caster!), for which a glass vial is required and an
exsanguination may be required.

Syntax: Exsaguinate <Target Corpse>
        
This command is used to extract blood from a corpse. A glass vial
will be needed to store the blood properly.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The Gate spell is a magic born of the void, allowing the caster to
literally tear a hole in the fabric of the material plane, stepping
directly through to the void. From the void, with focus born of
magical concentration, the caster is able to step out of the void,
through a doorway to elsewhere in the material plane. The spell
requires a target to focus the path through the void. No immortal
can be used, and a fellow adventurer that is protected by the gods
would be immune if they wished it. The victim has a chance to avoid
being used as an endpoint, and many places cannot be gated to at all.
Lastly, the trip is not without price, and the trip through the void
can injure the caster.

The heart of a living creature is required to power the gate spell.
The more powerful the heart, the more potent the gate which can
be created.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Nightfears' <Target>

The nightfears spell afflicts the target with horrific nightmares,
rendering them unable to properly sleep or rest. The spell can
be cast from afar, but requires an object recently owned by the
victim.

Syntax: Play 'The Mute God'

This ancient song tells the tale of a forgotten god, who loses his
voice bit by bit as his ungrateful followers desert him. Left
without a voice, the legend has it that was able to communicate
only through the chords of his lyre. Now, the song produces a
melodic sound that completely prevent any other sounds from entering or
leaving the bard's vicinity.

Syntax: Play 'The Day of Two Dawns'

A poem first composed by the legendary ch'taren bard Sy'kanse bore
this title, and this song sets those words to music. The poem

Syntax: Play 'Bane of Asjia'

Asjia was a caladaran mentalist of some great renown, who worked
tirelessly throughout his long life to bring peace to the shattered
and divided lands east of Earendam's reach. Largely successful, 
he met defeat only at the hands of a kankoran barbarian, who hewed
Asjia in twain with one fell stroke.  The telling of this tale in
song evokes some bit of chaotic magic that is disruptive to the 
mentalic powers of psionicists.

The song of the lone defender is a tale of an ancient soldier,
who comes out of retirement to defend his village from a
barbarian raiding party. Standing alone, he holds a mountain

and defend themselves with similar valor.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Play 'The Lay of Lilisa' 

This lay, or epic poem, tells a portion of the dark and tragic tale
of Lilisa. A daughter of one of Var Bandor's wealthiest merchant
family, Lilisa was ensnared by the lures of the god Serachel, and
trapped in the realm of dreams. In the end, she took her own life,
only to serve as an unwitting hold the dark god had on the heroic
assassin Sydonus. The Lord of the Damned used Lilisa to manipulate
Sydonus into dooming both of them to a dark immortality as guardians
of the Coven of the Shunned. So horrific is the magic and power
inherent in this song, all those who listen are subject to an
unnatural fear, which may cause even the staunchest warrior to 
flee from combat.

Syntax: Play 'The Feckless Nefortu'

The nefortu have a perhaps deserved reputation as a tricksome,

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

A bard, who often makes his living juggling or through other similar
applications of dexterity, will often find the tumbling skill of
use. Tumbling can allow a bard to take advantage of natural cover,
or to place himself outside the reach of certain attacks.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Mimic <Person> <Channel> <Message>
    Ex: Mimic Aurula say You are a churlish oaf!

The mimic ability allows a bard to mimic the appearance of a message
from another person. In the context of this ability, the channel
is one of Avendar's normal communication channels, and message is
the message you wish to send. Bards will find mimicking persons
very similar to their own in gender and race more effective.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Profession: Other
Class: Bard

Bards who have taken up a life of adventure are equal parts
musician, storyteller, entertainer, and actor. Historically,
bards have been everywhere and done everything in Avendar. From
marching alongside great armies, to traveling with explorers
into the wild unknown, bards compose and record songs of deeds
both great and small. The greatest bards have discovered that some
fragment of magic lies in music, and can use their songs with
astonishing effectiveness. The tales and songs brought by a bard
also hold great sway with the general populace. Thusly, bards of
level 40 or greater can send notes to ALL.

Syntax: Songbook <entry #> <edit/delete>

Bards, who are known for collecting and performing music, have a 
songbook in which his or her favorite songs are stored. 
Through the use of the songbook command, a bard can add songs
to his repertoire, to be performed at a later time.

Songs are entered into the songbook via the editor (see help EDIT).
Each individual song has an entry number, which is a positive integer.

Ex:

The worth command will bring up a quick spread of useful information,
detailing such things as the amount of gold you have, how much xp/ep

-1 BACKGROUND2~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|                 Extended Background Advice                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

In devising your character's background, here are a few things that
you should think about:

- At its most basic form, a background tells about your character's
past, showing the events that molded him/her into the person they
are today.  The more detailed backgrounds will even foreshadow the
character's future development, and give immortals possible hooks
for helping the process along.  It's generally a wise idea to add
notes about the important events, detailing how they affected the
character.

- Your character's background doesn't stop when he gets taken over
by a player.  If an important event happens to your character
during gameplay, it's always good to add it in.  A dynamic background
helps facilitate a dynamic character.

- Length: There is no set length for a background, and as indicated
above, we even hope that the length will change over time.  Should
you run into a problem with length, we recommend that you summarize
your background in the space provided, then provide a URL with the
complete version at the bottom.

- Style: Given that the background has its roots in narration,
questions about the style of presentation will naturally arise.
There have been numerous different kinds, such as journals, 
narrative tales, first and third person, and so forth.  While
none are inherently better than the rest, be sure that in
choosing your style, you choose one which will properly display
as many facets of your character as possible.  If necessary, add
in extra notes at the end, just to be be thorough.  (Note: Should
you decide to do a story, be sure that it has more relevance to
your character than just having his name in it.  Reading long,
pointless stories rarely brings a smile to immortal faces.)

- Spelling/Formatting: No matter how hard I try, I always have a hard
time taking a poorly written background seriously.  Seeing spelling
errors every other word, or even just seeing a huge, two-page chunk
of solid text without paragraphs, is usually enough to make me not
want to take the time to examine the thing carefully.  Using the
"bg format" command will help you immeasurably, so long as you
remember to hit enter twice to demarcate a paragraph.

- Originality: While the presentation doesn't have to be too special
or elaborate, the character itself should be.  Don't be another evil
person that killed his parents, or another Duddly Do-right that had
his parents murdered by shuddeni.  Even being something as simple as
a common soldier can turn out to be more refreshing and more
interesting than the stock melodramatic fantasy set-up.

-1 MERCY GRANTMERCY BEG~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|   MERCY                                                             |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Usage: mercy [death/beg/force]

By using the mercy command, a player can specify under what conditions
they will spare the life of a foe.  Using 'mercy' by itself will
display your current settings for granting mercy.  If you grant
mercy to your opponent, they will be held under your blade, and
able to do only a small number of actions.  Attempting to murder
someone who you have in such a state will immediately result in
their demise.

'mercy death' will toggle whether or not you will hold back on the
              death-dealing blow to a foe.
'mercy beg' will toggle whether or not you will grant mercy to an
            opponent who 'beg's for it.
'mercy force' will toggle whether or not you immediately finish off
              a foe you have granted mercy to if you are attacked
              by another.

A player may use the "beg" command to beg mercy of an opponent
who they are fighting, even if the deathblow is not imminent.

The "grantmercy" command will release a victim who you have at
your mercy.

Let it be known that at times the best of intentions will go
awry, and the deathblow cannot always be held back, particularly
when dealing with magic.  Gladiators, experienced in the ways of
such fighting, suffer less from this problem than others.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Usage: exdesc <add/edit/remove> <keywords>

Exdesc allows you to add additional descriptions to yourself,
referenced by keywords, that other people may look at.  You
may reference multiple words to a single exdesc by placing the
keywords in quotes.

Example: exdesc add 'long red scar'

The exdesc command will take you into the editor.  It is heavily
recommended that you familiarize yourself with the editor before
you use this feature.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/
Each race of Avendar has developed a unique language spoken among its
people. The most widely used language is the common tongue developed
by the humans; the various non-human languages are spoken in the more
remote regions of the lands. Alatharya once spoke a beautiful and
complex language of their own, but through their fall it has been
lost. Alatharya now speak common. There is also a specialized language
spoken only by mages and templars. This language, known as 'Arcane', is
uttered when spells are cast.
As adventurers begin their career in Avendar, they choose the languages
they will be proficient in. To learn further languages, an adventurer
must find a teacher willing to help him practice, just as with any
skill in Avendar. New languages can only be practiced to a minimal
extent. Further ability must be gained through speaking the language,
and listening to others speak it.

NOTE: when practicing the ch'taren language, refer to it as "chtaren".

Language commands:

Languages: displays what languages you speak, and how well.

Speak <language>: changes the language you are currently speaking.
"Speak" with no argument shows the language you are speaking.

Translate: toggles whether or not you see the fully translated text
when you speak.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Think <Thought>

The think command is a roleplaying tool, for your character to think

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Those who use magic can be adversely affected by the weight of the
armor they wear. Armor on the hands, arms, or body can prevent the
casting of spells. Templars, who combine both the arts of magic and
skill in combat, are less likely to be adversely affected by the
weight of armor. 

To see if you are encumbered, you can use the WORTH command.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Chess is a game played on an 8*8 grid of alternating black and white
squares. Players begin with two rows of pieces, each placed on an
opposite sides of the board. The chess board at the beginning of the
game appears as follows:

a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h
  ---------------------------------
1 | R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |
  ---------------------------------    White:
2 | P | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |    Player1
  ---------------------------------
3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    Black:
  ---------------------------------    Player2
4 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

  ---------------------------------
7 | P | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
  ---------------------------------
8 | R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |
  ---------------------------------

It is currently white's turn to move.


Different letters represent different pieces, which have distinct
movement patterns, and all have distinct methods of removing opposing
pieces from the board. 

The abilities of the chess pieces are summarized in help 
CHESS PIECES. Read this now.

In chess, the two sides, white and black, each take turns.

By tradition, the person playing white goes first. 

On each turn, a player may move one and only one piece, subject
to the constraints in help CHESS PIECES. 

The object of the game is to place the opponent's king in CHECKMATE.

We say that a king is in CHECK if on the current state of the board,
the king can be captured on the opponent's next turn.

We say that a king is in CHECKMATE if it is in check, and no move
the king's owner can make will take the king out of check.

A player wins if he can put an opponent's king in checkmate.

There are other ways for a chess game to end:

The game ends in a draw if:

-Both players agree to a draw
or
-A given board pattern repeats three times in a row. (This is meant 
to indicate that the game is stalled) 
or
-It is clear that checkmate cannot be forced (i.e., two kings remain)
or
-Stalemate: An opponent's king is not in check, but he cannot move the
king without placing it in check, and the only possible moves available
to the player involve moving the king.

-1 'CHESS PIECES' CHESSPIECE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Chess Pieces                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

We refer to chess pieces by the symbols used by the game. (Read help
CHESS RULES for a picture of a chess board).

P: Pawns
Pawns are the most basic unit in chess. Pawns move forward, one 
square at a time, toward the opposing player. On their first move,
pawns may optionally move forward by two squares. Rather than 
moving, a pawn may opt to capture an opposing pieces which are 
diagonally forward and adjacent to the pawn. 

Thus, if we had:

K * B
* P * 

The pawn in question could either move forward, or opt to capture
the opponent's Knight or Bishop. 

Pawn's also have two additional special properties:

(1) Pawns which reach the eighth row of the chess board (i.e., the
opponent's back row) become queens.

(2) En passante:

The following special case allows one pawn to capture another by
moving diagonally onto the square behind another pawn.

Suppose:

(i) A pawn moves two squares forward.
(ii) An opposing pawn is located horizontally adjacent to the final
location of the pawn that moved two squares.

then, and only then, can the opposing pawn take the other 'en passante'. 

To illustrate:

Suppose we have:

* P *
* * *
* * p 

Then, the owner of pawn P takes his turn:

* * *
* * * 
* P p 

Then, the owner of pawn p may take P 'en passante':

* * * 
* p * 
* * *      

Notice, p moves diagonally behind P, and captures P. 


R: Rooks

Rooks begin the game in the upper or lower corners of the board. 
Rooks move horizontally or vertically (but not both at once), and may move as many squares forward or to the side they wish until they encounter an obstacle. Rooks capture opposing pieces by moving horizontally or vertically onto the square of the opposing piece.

N: Knights

Knights begin the game in the squares horizontally adjacent to the rooks. Knights move in an 'L' shape fashion, moving either 
one square horizontally and two vertically, or two horizontally and 
one vertically. Any opposing piece on the square the knight lands
on is captured.

So, if we have a knight:

* * * * *
* * * * *
* * N * * , the following are all possible knight moves:

* N * * *   * * * N *   * * * * *  * * * * *
* * * * *   * * * * *   N * * * *  * * * * N
* * * * * , * * * * *,  * * * * *, * * * * * 

B: Bishops

Bishops begin the game horizontally adjacent to the knights.
Bishops may move diagonally as far as they wish (but not in both directions at once), until they encounter an obsctable. Bishops
capture opposing pieces by moving diagonally onto the square 
located onto the opposing space. 

Q: Queens

Queens begin the game horizontal adjacent to the bishop and king.
Queens can move horizontal and vertically like a rook, or diagonally
like a bishop (but not both at once). Queens capture in the same 
fashion as rooks or bishops. 

K: King

The king is the most important chess piece, as its safety determines
whether the game is won or lost.

Kings move just like queens, subject to the caveat that they only move
one square at a time. 

Kings, unlike other pieces, cannot move into a position of danger.
A 'position of danger' is a location on the board where the opponent
could take the king on their next turn. In chess parlance, kings
cannot 'move into check'.

The game is won when the opponent's king is in 'check' (in a position of danger), and no move the opponent makes can take the king out of check (checkmate).

Kings cannot be captured: only placed in check, or checkmate.

Kings have a special move available to them, known as 'castling', which
involves the rooks. For a king to castle, the following must be true:

(1) Neither the king or the rook may have moved this game.
(2) All pieces horizontally between the king and rook must have moved,
leaving the squares blank.

Kings can castle on their side, or the queen's side.

King's side castling occurs as follows:

The king moves two squares toward the rook.
The rook then moves one square past the king, on the side opposite

Thus:

* * * * K * * R  (before castling)
* * * * * R K *  (after castling)


Queen's side castling occurs as follows:

The king moves two squares toward the rook.
The rook then moves one square past the king, on the side opposite the
rook's previous location.

Thus: 

R * * * K * * * (before castling)
* * K R * * * * (after castling)

Castling is carried out within the game's chess engine by 
instructing the king to move two spaces to the left or right.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Retreat

Fighters, assasins, and thieves may all attempt to retreat from 
combat. Retreating combatants must not currently be the subject
of an attack, and allows the individual to simply step back from 
a fight. Classes without the skill may still attempt to retreat with
less success.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Leech Rune' <Target Weapon>

The leech rune is employed by void templars, who use it to create
a weapon which binds itself to the hand of the wearer. The rune is
not without its costs, however: for the duration of the spell, the
weapon will draw on the life force of whomever wields it.
~

-1 'DEMONIC HOWL'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Demonic Howl                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Demonic Howl'

Used by templars of the void, this spell allows the caster to scream
with a demonic power. Channeling this unholy energy provides a bonus
to the void templar and his group, and has a chance to instill terror
in others in the room who are currently fighting.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Curse of Kijjasku'

A legendary shuddeni associated with the origins of Yithoul, Kijjasku
is said to have uttered the words to this curse upon his own death. The
spell survives in its present form, wherein it invokes a terrible curse
on whoever slays the templar.

dark tentacles to entangle their foe, substantially hindering their
combat ability.
~


-1 'GLOBE OF DARKNESS' GLOBE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Globe of Darkness                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Globe of Darkness'

Used by void templars to deceive their foes, this spell calls a 
globe of darkness in a room. Darker than the black of night, this
spell negates the effect of normal light sources for the duration.
~


-1 SIPHON 'SIPHON MANA'~

A spell designed by void templars to drain the resources of their foe
on the field of battle, siphon mana allows them to steal the magic
of their victim, adding it to their own.
~



-1 'BLIGHT OF ADDUTHALA'~

|        Blight of Adduthala                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Blight of Adduthala' <Target>

One of the curses in the repertoire of void templars, the blight of
adduthala makes the target more susceptible to magic, and increases
their own weakness to the power of the void.
~


-1 'DEMONIC POSSESSION'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Demonic Possession                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Demonic Possession'

This spell allows a void templar to cause their body to temporarily 
become inhabitated by a demonic spirit. The spirit brings with it an
unholy viciousness, resulting in a demonic ability in physical combat.
The spell is not without its disadvantages, however -- among them, 
a vulnerability to holy attacks, and the physical price that is 
exacted when the demon leaves the void templar's body.
~



-1 PESTILENCE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Pestilence                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Phase Door' <Target>

A variant on the gate spell used by void scholars, phase door was 
perfected for use by templars of the void on the battlefield. Phase
door allows the templar to travel to a target in the same region,
but will cause injury based on travel through the negative planes.
~


-1 'FLAY'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Flay                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Flay <Target>

The flay skill allows the use of a whip to lacerate a victim's flesh.
Those flayed suffer an impediment to strength, due to the damage to 
muscle tissue.

-1 'FORM OF THE WRAITH'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Form of the Wraith                                           |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Assume Form of the Wrath

Combining the magics of void and the meditative discipline of 
swordmasters, the form of the wraith is a defensive form learned by
void templars. While within the form, a void templar exists partially
within the plane of the void, and will be resistant to most forms of
damage. Unfortunately, this proximity to the void results in an
increased vulnerability to holy attacks.
~


-1 'FORM OF THE ASP'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Form of the Asp                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Assume Form of the Asp

Combining the magics of void and the meditative discipline of 
swordmasters, the form of the asp is a sword form learned by 
void templars. It allows the templar to strike deep, lasting blows 
into the victim, which the templar then injects a burst of negative
energy into, resulting in bleeding and a loss of ability.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Jaws of Idcizon' <Target Shield>

This spell, used by void templars, binds a shield with an Idcizon, 
a demon known for its horrific jaws. Shields bonded to an Idcizon
tear at bare-handed attacks in combat, and may occasionally snatch
a weapon out of the hands of the attacker.

This spells requires that a trigon of binding be present.

Syntax: Cast 'Hunger of Grmlarloth' <Target Weapon>

This spell, used by void templars, binds a ravenous Grmlarloth into
a weapon. Weapons bound to a Grmlarloth develop the demon's 
ravenous taste for blood, and as the weapon inflicts wounds, it 
grows more powerful (albeit temporarily).

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Combining the diabolic magic of the void with a keen swordmanship,
templars of the void are among the most feared in Avendar. The
origins of their training lie with the shuddeni, who first trained
those of their own number to utilize both swordplay and the dark 
arts. Combining the two leads to a fearful mixture, resulting in
a templar who can bind demons into their weapons, while draining 
the magical energy of their foes to replenish themselves. Void 
templars have SKILLS, SPELLS, and FORMS.

Void Templar abilities unclude:

Flay, Curse of Kijjasku, Jaws of Idcizon, Demonic Possession

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Pmote <Message>

The pmote command is similar to the EMOTE command, with the following
exception: every occurence of a person's name in a pmote string is 
replaced by the appropriate pronoun. 

Ex:
Three players, Iandir, Jolinn, and Aeolis are standing in a room.

Iandir types:
pmote looks at Jolinn.
Jolinn sees:
Iandir looks at you.
Iandir sees:
Iandir looks at Jolinn.
Aeolis sees:

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The srryn followers of Sythrak, known to mortals as the Saurian Sept,
walk the land with but one purpose, to serve and fear the immortal word 
of their god.  Destruction and havoc come in their wake, as the strong
overwhelm all who show signs of weakness.  Brute strength has many uses 
to break the will of the weak may be more useful than spilling blood, 
as every srryn overlord enjoys his warmblood slaves.  Exhibiting the 
strength and brutality of their srryn elders in every form, the Sept 
shun weakness, knowing that by giving in to their own weakness makes 
them no more superior than the warmblood swine that that exists around 
them.  This brutality does not end among the ranks of the Sept.  The 
children of Sythrak constantly fight amongst themselves, rending one 
another to prove their strength to their immortal Lord, and perhaps 
gain his favor.  Brandings are passed among the ranks of the Sept like 
trophies, to be gained only through battle and bloodshed. Because of 
these brutal guidelines, honor holds no place in the Sept -- only 
animal instinct.

Often, the Sept are used as tools of Sythrak to extend his reach over 
the mortal realm, serving as assassins or messengers for their lord. 
Failure at these tasks has grave consequences. One who fails to obey 
their Lord or complete these tasks fully are to be punished by Sythrak 
himself.  Failure is weakness, and weakness is not tolerated within the 
ranks of the Sept. While ancient texts state it can only be srryn that 
speak to Sythrak on the matter of the Sept, rules can be bent to 
include warmblood toys.  Warmbloods that wish to serve Sythrak and his
 Sept are kept as slaves, used in battles and sacrificed as he wishes. 
Such servants of the Sept are regarded as the lowest form of life, and 
are to be kept as pets of the Srryn Overlord himself. Those that seek 
an audience with Sythrak should address a note to him directly, 
explaining why they deem themselves fit to enter the ranks of the
Saurian Sept.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Cast 'Soulflare' <Target>

The soulflare spell was perfected by spirit templars, who first used
it in battle against the shuddeni. The soulflare calls forth a blast
of light, which can blind the target, and their group. In the case of
shuddeni, the light sears at their flesh, inflicting substantial 
damage.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Astral Form'

Used by spirit templars, the astral form spell allows templars to 
exist partially in the astral plane. While in this form, the templars
will be able to avoid blows, and pass through doors using their 
partially insubstantial state. The astral form also provides some 
protection against brute force attacks, such as bash.

Spirit templars, adept at manipulating the connection between spirit 
magic and the dream realms, can gain substantial control over their
own dreams. This allows them to awaken from unnatural forms of sleep,
assuming they are sufficiently skilled.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Sanctify'

Originally used to defend swaths of battlefield, the sanctify spell
is used by spirit templars to sanctify a given locale. Ground that has
been sanctified offers numerous advantages. Demonic beings find it 
difficult to tread sanctified ground, and summonings, dark rituals,
and other void magics fail. Those of pure heart are inspired to resist
evil magic and fight evil all the harder, and those of evil bent
suffer similar penalties.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Exorcism' <Target>

The rites of exorcism are used by spirit templars to combat the magics

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Positive Channel' Open
        Cast 'Positive Channel' Close

Spirit templars use the positive channel spell to open up a conduit
to the plane of positive energy. While infused with this energy, the
templar's own natural abilities are substantially enhanced, and they
fight with unparalleled prowess. There is a danger to drawing on
this much power, however -- the longer the templar is infused with
positive energy, the more taxing it will be on their own body's 
reserves.

-1 'RITE OF NATHLI'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Rite of Nathli                                              |

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Sortie

Spirit templars may attempt to lead a sortie against their opponents,
striking at each person attacking them. Their groupmates will take

Syntax: Cast 'Wrath of Kyana' <target>

Spirit templars, oft afield on the road or on campaigns, created this

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Spirit templars combine the magics of spirit with the combat 
abilities of a warrior. Historically, spirit templars first appeared
in Avendar with the arrival of the ch'taren, and the defeat of the
shuddeni in the War of Night. Their magic is focused on purity,
unlocking their own potential, and tapping the powers of the spirit
realm. Due to their intense devotion to the cause of the light,
spirit templars must be of the light.

Spirit Templar powers include:

Positive Channel, Spirit Sanctuary, Sortie, Soul Flare

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Unseen Servant' <Item> <Character>

Used by spirit templars to transfer imporant messages or items on
the field of battle, this spell takes an item in the spirit 
templar's possession and transfers it to the target character. 
The astral creature which transports the item is not omnipotent
however, and will find it difficult to bring objects to targets
in magic resistant areas. Those with who have the 'nosummon' state
set will be unreachable by the unseen servant. Additionally, the
transport is not perfect -- depending on the templars ability with
the spell, the item may be lost en route.

-1 EDIT EDITOR~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Editor                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Note Edit
        Desc Edit
        Background Edit 

An editor exists for editing the main body of your notes, descriptions,
and backgrounds.

Once you activate the editor, you will be given a prompt that looks 
like this:

>

At the prompt, you can type whatever text you want to add to your 
note or description. 

To enter editor commands, you must go to a newline. All editor 
commands are prefaced by a ".", with the exception of "@". The
commands are as follows:

.c Clear all text from the editor (Delete everything)
.s Show everything written so far, as it will appear.
.h Get help on editor commands.
.f Format your text (No more messy notes or descriptions!)
@  Leave the editor

WARNING: While in the editor, you can input no mud commands to
your character. This puts you at some risk to attack if you are
unprepared, so be mindful of the possibilities.

NOTE: If you're using the zMUD client, you may need to disable
"." as your movement character before using the editor.  Read
help ZMUD for details.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

In order to use the string editor with the zMUD client, you may be
required to disable "." as the movement character in order to use
the special editor commands.  To accomplish this, do the following:

- Pull down the View menu, and select Preferences
- Click on Special Characters
- Make sure the Enabled checkbox beside the "." Movement Character
  option is unchecked.

The above instructions are for the newest version of zMUD (6.16), but
similar steps can be used in older versions, with minor changes.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The BACKGROUND command allows a character to describe their 
background. 

Your background describes your character's past -- and it should 
include whatever you know about your own past, and what a god would
know about you and your history.

The background is meant to have a twofold use. Firstly, it allows
the immortals to ensure that everyone has a well-roleplayed 
character. Secondly, it allows the gods to understand your actions,
and allows for more subtle, and complicated roleplaying.

Only the immortals can read your background.

You are required to have a background by level 25. 

To enter your background, use the BACKGROUND command:

Background + :    Add a line to your background
Background - :    Remove a line from your background
Background clear: Clears your background completely
Background:       Shows your background
Background edit:  Edit your background completely*

* Be sure to read help EDIT before you use this command.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Focus <Psionic Ability> <Optional Target>
        Focus
        Unfocus <Number>

The FOCUS command allows a psionicist to exert one of his or her
mental powers. 

Ex: Focus 'Paranoia' Jolinn

Some psionic focuses exert a temporary affect (such as shove), while
others exert a lasting influence (such as Paranoia). Lasting psionic
effects drain mana from the psionicist for as long as they are in
effect. Unlike magical affects, psionic influences last until their
victim can overcome the will of the psionicist, rather than having
a fixed duration.

Psionicists can maintain a maximum of eight focuses at once. Some
focuses will require more than one focus slot to maintain, and
the total number of foci possible will increase over the course
of the psionicists career.

To get a list of their current focuses, FOCUS by itself will 
provide the psionicist with a list. 

To end a focus, a psionicist can UNFOCUS the slot number (given in
the focus list).

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

A secretive conclave of sorcerers and practitioners of black witchcraft, 
members of the Coven of the Shunned seek to subjugate the minds and 
hearts of those of weaker will to their dark purpose. Initiates of the 
Coven delve into mysteries both forbidden and infernal, and readily make 
pacts with demonkind in their ruthless ambition. The ultimate goals of 
the Coven are shrouded in secrecy, although it is said that they carry 
out the will of the dark gods upon Avendar, in exchange for unholy 
favour.

The Coven of the Shunned is known to have a highly organised structure, 
with multiple positions of authority within. The schemes of Coven 
Initiates tend to be similarly well structured - in many cases years of 
planning will precede the fruition of their goals. Although political 
manouvering within the Coven structure is commonplace, Initiates tend 
to be fanatically loyal to the Coven itself. This is in part because 
many of their magicks may only be cast in concert with other Initiates, 
but loyalty is also ensured through rumours of the dark fates met by 
those who have betrayed the secrets of the Shunned.

It is told that two sects make up the Coven of the Shunned. Wielders of 
magic and the masters of mindcraft are trained to turn their studies to 
darkness, and to enfold infernal power into all their works. Those of a 
more martial calling may find a place in the vanguard of the Shunned, 
whereby making pacts with the demon houses allied with the Coven they 
gain unholy power over enemies and minions alike.

Admission to the Coven of the Shunned may be sought by penning a letter 
to "Shunned". Details of your history, deeds and motivations should 
there be set down, including an exposition of how the Coven will be 
benefitted by your acceptance.

-1 AEOLIS ROSE 'GUARDIAN OF THE ROSE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Aeolis                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Note: The god Aeolis is currently semi-retired. Prayers for his
attention are not likely to be answered.

The story of Aeolis is one of a life of purity and romance, ended
in a great tragedy.  A true gallant in both spirit and manner, Aeolis
travelled across Avendar revelling in its beauty, its purity, and its
women.  A romantic at heart, seldom did he pass through a town without
leaving his name on the lips of the fair ladies within.  His valorous
deeds were spoken of far and wide, yet he was never heard boasting of
his accomplishments. He found many to love throughout his travels, but
it is said that he died defending his one true love from a great evil,
buying her time to escape with her life.

    Jolinn, saddened by the death of one of such purity, sensed that 
Aeolis embodied the essence of love, romanticism, and gallantry, and 
ascended the aelin into the heavens after his noble death.  Now, after
centuries spent working in the heavens to further his beliefs across
the planes, the release of the god of corruption, Serachel, and the
growing prominence of the god of hatred, Bayyal, has brought Aeolis
back into mortal view, to help counter this evil flow by spreading
the ways of gallantry around the land.

    Those who follow the beliefs of Aeolis strive to live their lives
in the spirit of gallantry.  Romantics at heart, they believe that 
love is life, or perhaps that life is love, and to be virtuous is the 
only way to truly live. Purity and innocence are to be cherished and 
protected, as they lead one to a heart free of darkness.  Aesthetics 
are important, frivolity accepted, as they can both lighten the heart,
but one should never acquire vast wealth for personal desire lest the
virtue of such things be lost.

    Music and art are of high value to followers of the Rose, as both 
touch the hearts of those who are subjected to them, and many sweet
courtings have come to finality after a well placed melody, or a quiet 
recital of poetry.  Those who bear Aeolis' mark often pursue at least 
one form of art, although this is out of personal desire, and not 
necessarily a requirement of all who venerate him.

    Followers of Aeolis are often found in the company of members of 
the opposite sex, acting in a chivalrous manner, and living life with 
love in their hearts, and the ways of gallantry in their minds.  They
can also often be found in peaceful solitude,  working on their next 
piece to woo the hearts of those they encounter, or perhaps on some 
romantic quest, saving a noble princess, or showing their valour in 
fighting a beast which threatens the purity of the land.  Although at
times they will take up arms in active pursuit of evil, they are far
more likely to be roused to action in an act of defense, rather than
offense, particularly when they can prove their courage in defending
the opposite sex. 

    Those who wish to bear the mark of Aeolis should seek out his
shrine from which to pray to him, or any other location in Avendar
that embodies his beliefs.

-1 BAYYAL 'LORD OF FLAME' FLAME~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Bayyal                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Bayyal, the Lord of Hatred and Destruction, takes the form of a
pitch-black nefortu with eyes of flame. A harbinger of Chaos and Evil,
Bayyal revels in the destruction of all structured, orderly societies,
and takes glee in fomenting hatred amongst mortals. Bayyal is the
patron god of fire scholars and templars, and it is said that he first
appeared in these lands not long after the srryn shamans developed
fire magic.

Bayyal accepts as followers the most fervent and wicked among the
mortals who strive for his favor. He demands that his followers act
out of pure hatred, and that they cling to none for support. Each
follower's means of living the principles of Hatred and Destruction
may vary, but all tread a dangerous path by associating themselves
with Bayyal, as it is rumored that their lord will occasionally
incinerate them for sport. He takes particular pleasure in seeing his
followers fight amongst themselves.

The Lord of Hatred brands those he accepts with the mark of flame.
Those who dare to seek this path should address a scroll to Bayyal
explaining themselves.

-1 'SHOOT'~

              <aimed/normal/quick>                                          

The shoot skill is used to fire an arrow from a bow (which must be
held).  The target of shoot is any pc or npc visible to the person
shooting. There are four "basic" types of arrow, which are stored 
in your quiver. The four basic types are as follows:

Short: Base range of 2 
Medium: Base range of 3
Long: Base range of 4
Barbed: Base range of 2, barbed tip inflicts bleeding damage

The direction is the direction of your target. 

Three types of targeting can be used for the speed with which an arrow
is targeted:

Quick: Low accuracy, quick recovery
Normal: Average accuracy, normal recovery
Aimed: High accuracy, delay before firing 

In addition to firing arrows of the 'normal' types, there will be
occasionally arrows with various special (magical, etc.) properties
that can be fired.  To shoot these arrows, you must first load them
with the NOCK command [see help NOCK], and omit the argument of basic
arrow type.

In general, you can omit any of these arguments except for the target,
and the arrow fired will default to medium range (or the type you have
nocked)  and of normal firing time. Omitting a direction will attempt
to find the target automatically. In general, as long as the 'shoot'
command is first, the argument may be given in any order.

Finally, normal arrow types may be lit using the IGNITE [see help
IGNITE] command. Once ignited, the arrow will automatically fire when
the shoot command is used.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Nock <Special Arrow type>

(with no arguments) will remove a nocked arrow.

-1 SERACHEL 'ANGEL OF DARKNESS'~

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Serachel (SER-a-kel) was once a being of the light, whose influence extended 
over culture, art, beauty, and dreams. He was, in particular, a driving force 
in the development of high Aelin culture after the War of Fire, in which he 
served by Jolinn's side. It was during the ascendancy of the great Aelin 
cities that Serachel began his long fall from grace. Often walking amongst the 
Aelin as one of their own, he immersed himself in their intrigues and 
endeavours, and became more and more enamored with the worldly pleasures of 
mortals. Finally Serachel took for himself followers, and developed a 
creed advocating indulgence of desire and intemperance, urging the Aelin 
to seek ever greater heights of asthetic grace and power. Serachel instructed 
his followers in the fine arts of social deception, teaching them how to 
inspire trust and love for the purposes of manipulation. In this way his 
people gained great power amongst the Aelin. Serachel himself was a great 
master at masking his true intentions, and it wasn't until the War of Night 
that his corruption was finally revealed. Fearing the destruction of the 
culture he had reared, he abandoned all his former pretenses and urged the 
Aelin to study the magics of the Void, so that they might defeat the Shuddeni 
and establish a mighty empire of their own, one which he promised would rival 
the very gods in its greatness. Serachel was defeated by Rystaia at the end 
of the war, and imprisoned beyond the Nightmare Realms, where he had earlier 
made his abode. It was a thousand years before, through manipulation of group 
of mortals, he managed to escape.

Only very few follow Serachel openly. He does not conduct an organised 
religion, and only one or two ancient and isolated aelin cities hold temples 
dedicated to him. The majority of those bearing the sigil of Serachel do 
so in secret. Of these there are two kinds. 

Firstly, those who have in some way been ensnared by Serachel's promises. 
Using his native power over the realm of dreams, Serachel easily divines the 
hopes and fears in the hearts of mortals. In this way he seeks to corrupt 
the spirits of those he wishes to bring into his service. Although the 
rewards promised by Serachel seem worth any self-depredation, the price 
finally paid is invariably far greater than expected.

The second class of follower are those who whose ideals coincide with 
Serachel's. Aesthetic abandon, ambition, and a reprobate mind, as well as 
skill in duplicity and temptation are some of the qualities Serachel has 
been known to seek and encourage in his servants. The pure of heart and the 
chaotic of spirit have little chance of winning the favour of Serachel.

Regardless of the path taken into Serachel's fold, those who serve him are 
branded with the Sigil of the Shadow Mask. This sigil is invisible to the 
mortal eye, as Serachel prefers his followers to serve him in secret, in 
many cases from positions of power normally unholdable by one bearing the 
dark god's mark. Yet it is said that there are a very small number of mortals 
who wear Serachel's sigil openly. These are a rare few who have proven their 
loyalty and worth, and been chosen as Serachel's representatives amongst 
mortal kind.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Prepare <Number of Vials of Catalyst> <Type of poison>

In order to use darts or to taint food or water, a vial of poison is
required. Preparing these vials of poison requires the use of a 
catalyst, which will effect the duration of the taint or the dart 
(the more catalyst used, the longer the dart lasts, or the food 
remains tainted). Vials of catalyst are usually available from the
trainers of assassins.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Vital <victim>

Using a dagger, an assassin may attempt to make a precise strike at
the victim's vital organ. Each such wound inflicts little damage on its
own, but it does cause blood to be lost. If a given victim is wounded
enough times in this fashion, he will perish from internal injuries.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Here on Avendar, we have an innovative way of handling commands.
Along with the regular commands, which you can use anywhere (you
can see a list of these by typing COMMANDS), we also feature a 
system where you can use additional verbs on certain rooms or objects.

The long and short of this is that you can do things like:

PULL cord
TURN knob
CUT rope
KNOCK on door
PUSH boulder
etc.

If you cannot use a verb in a particular place, but it is used somewhere, 
you will be told "You can't do that here" if you attempt it.

Watch for clues in the descriptions of rooms, monsters, and items for
when a given verb will be appropriate.

-1 STORY HISTORY~

In the beginning, were the gods. Some to create,
some to destroy, some to taint, others to bring
hope, others to simply be. The gods, though, were
alone in the universe. Seeking a canvas for their
essence, they created the world of Avendar.
And, edged along ever so carefully by the gods
of creation, they created the alatharya,
FirstChildren of the gods. 

To the alatharya, the gods gave their greatest
gift - Magic. Magic to create, magic to destroy,
magic, some portion of each of the gods'
essences was sent to swirl through the prime
material, creating the ether from which mages
drew. 

As time passed, the latharya waxed mighty. The
gods, pleased, began plans for other creations,
each mighty in their own way. But the Alatharya
were not content with the god's plans to make
others - jealous of the thought that other
children might bring the god's attention away
from them, and coveting the Quintessence, they
sought to steal the power of the gods. With their
mighty pyramids, and strange rites, their priests
and scholars came together one fateful night for
a grand theft. In their hubris, they sought to
steal the power of the gods for themselves, and
make of themselves Creators. 

But, alas, it was not to be. The gods knew of the
theft, and instead of invoking the power of the
gods, they invoked their deepest and darkest
wrath. All across Avendar, the great cities of the
alatharya were rent in blood and fire - their
libraries burned, their pyramids turned to
rubble, their homes driven to the four winds. The
revenge of a god is not a small thing, and the
revenge of the combined might of a pantheon can
level entire worlds. So it was that the Alatharya
were cast from their pinnacle as the mightiest of
races. No more would the minds of the Alatharya
follow the intracies of magic - nor would the
Alatharya do nought than strive for balance in
their day to day life, fearful of retribution for
their ancient crime. And, lastly, the gods
sundered Magic from its pure form into its
elemental components. Water, Spirit, Wind, Fire,
Void, and Earth did it break them, and forever
shatter the mortal dream of attaining the divine
through mystic arts. 

This sundering of the Magic released cataclysmic
storms of magic over the surface of Avendar, which
changed and alteried all that they touched. Of the
god's new children, vast changes were wrought,
some for good, some for ill. The aelin were
granted flight, and the gift of keen reason. The
caldarans learned wisdom, and were turned from
the night. At the same time, the brutal srryn
were born, spawn of languid swamp and foul
hearts. Beneath the earth fled the shuddeni,
blind minions of pure darkness, driven mad, some
say, by a love of much knowledge. 

The centuries after the Sundering of Magic were
dark ones. It was not until some hundreds of
years that civilization began anew, with the proud
selin and their cities in the skies. Striving,
perhaps, for a memory of things past, they
collected the artifacts of the ancient slatharya,
and built cities that at least faintly echoed the
glories of ancient days. 

And so it was the selin waxed powerful, the
srryn confined to their torpid swamps and the
shuddeni to their caves, and all others brought
into alliance with them. For a time, it appeared the
world would never again know such a destruction,
until, at last, the gods allowed a new race to
awaken on Avendar - the humans. 

The humans were taken by any and all things,
some easily swayed to evil, others relentless
paragons of virtue. Some claimed them akin to
gods, others to devil-spawn of the Void, others
still to reckless children. Nevertheless, the
passion that drove the humans lead them, at first,
into a reckless alliance with the brutal srryn. 

In their midnight rituals, the srryn had learned
much of the ways of fire. Fire to burn, fire to
make their will be done - fire, to destroy. The
humans, always more keen of wit, seized the
secrets of the srryn fire shamans, cultivated
among their numbers the first Scholars of Fire.
Savage men, of an unholy taste for pleasure and
power, unleashed their magics across the surface
of Avendar. 

Securing the yoke about their fellow men, the
great Scholars of Fire also trained warlords, or
templars of fire, to command in battle with the
sword, and yet still reign destruction with the
forces of fire. Most of the races scattered
before the hordes of humans and srryn that
plundered all they found, but the aelin stood to
defend their cities, and forged an alliance to
fight to keep the humans at bay, lest the night
consume all. 

Cities were reduced to ash. Aelin died in droves,
using their already small collection of ancient
artifacts to drive the humans back. And yet, again
and again the humans surged forward. Quick to
breed, quick to die, the humans stood at the
verge of a destruction that would consume all. 

Fortunately, not all among the humans thought as
the Scholars of Fire. Small in number, but
present, were humans who sought meaning in
more than brute destruction. Groping blindly,
they sought to bring peace, to heal, to purify.
They craved a life spent in other activity than
blind devotion to an orgy of chaos and
destruction. 

Praying to the gods, they were answered. Jolinn,
Father of the Seas, Lord of the Sapphire Spear,
sent these brave few to seek the titans, who
dwelt high in the mountains, where they had
slumbered since the Sundering. Waking, they
taught the humans of the magics of Water, and of
the strength of the Seas. These humans
returned, and became the first of the Scholars
of Water. Born to bring healing to a troubled
land, their love of life quenched the inferno of the
fire mage's hate. With their aid, the aelin drove
the armies of Fire back to the swamps, where
most of the Scholars of Fire were put to the
sword. 

Thus ended what the chronicles tell of as the War
of Fire, when men nearly brought ruin once more
to the world. 

And yet, the aelin were not the ones to come to
dominance after the war. The humans, their
passion driving them still, slowly grew in numbers
across the surface of Avendar, while the aelin
remained in their cities, lost in the intracicies of
their own life. 

Those humans not already devoted to healing
learned much of the ways of earth from the god
Iandir, who brought law once more to the hills and
valleys of Avendar. Men paused in their mad
growth, and built cities, homes, places of staying,
order, and protection. 

And thus, many thousands of years passed.
Quarrels came and went, but none so great as a
war to drench and entire world in Fire. And so it
was that the empire of the Humans subsumed the
entire world. And yet, the humans were drawn to
more than just the surface, and began their
explorations of the nether regions of Avendar.
There, they found the great cities of the
shuddeni, a race blinded by the night, but who
still saw much, and gloried in the horror of the
demon sultans who taught them. 

Here, human scholars went who wished to learn
more. Tortured they were by the shuddeni, but
some, a few, learned their ways. Combining the
ritual of the shuddeni with the ancient learning of
the humans, the discipline of the Void was born. 

Who can say why the gods suffer such things to
exist? Certainly, the gods of the dark revel in the
Void, the Things which inhabit it not always of
their own creation, but often after their own
heart. Certainly, what the Scholars of the Void
did was the antithesis of life, and everything
living, but the gods of light could not bring and
end to them without disturbing the balance of the
world. 

So it was, those humans who studied with the
Shuddeni waxed mighty in their counsuls, and
taught the shuddeni much of the ways of war. The
shuddeni culture, grown stagnant in their
millennia under stone, was re-energized by the
promise of conquest above the surface. On the
blackest night, of the darkest day of the year,
the humans and their shuddeni allies road forth
from the caves of their dank abyss, to usher in an
age of Night the world had never known. 

Striking with meaning, order, and purpose rather
than out of blind rage, the forces of the Void
took cities, rather than burning them, and
corrupted them to their will. Mothers were
forced to offer their children as appeasement in
unholy rites, designed to serve the Things which
dwell beyond, some were kept as slaves, but the
cities under the sway of the Void lived, even if
they were more the corpses of cities than
anything resembling a living organism. 

The templars of water mounted counter-assault
after counter-assault. Some times, with success,
other times, with failures. For long 
years, the two sides held sway in a series of
enormous battles. With time, thought, the
Scholars of Water found their magic growing
weaker - the Things of the void had grown strong
on the flesh of the young, and pressed for more
mortal flesh. When all seem darkest, when even
great Earandam thought to send its children to
the aelin amidst the moutain, the unthinkable
happend in the ranks of the Void. 

Their dark rites prepared, their rituals chanted,
they brought forth not demons or other Things,
they brought forth instead the ch'taren. The
ch'taren, whether exiles from the world of
dreams or even the fabled astral plane, had used
the magic of the void against itself, and had
travelled into the Prime Material by means of
their gateways. 

Bringing with them large numbers and the magics
of the Spirit, they routed the dreadlord templars
of the void to their holes in the ground, where
those that served Fire waited, and picked off the
weak among them. Humans learned of the
freedom of the Spirit, and everywhere, cast off
their chains, and drove the fiends of the Void
back once more into seclusion. 

And, thus ended the War of the Night, where
men learned that the candle of hope flickers even
in the blackest of times. 

The ch'taren settled among men, whose empire
lies shattered. The other races, long secluded by
humankind, came forth to a new Renaissance.
Some learned of the ways of the aelin, and
brought forth their own creation - the magic of
Air, which sought no rule, order, or code, merely
meaning in its own chaotic existence. 

Thus, all six of the great elemental magics were
brought to Avendar. Men, in time, sought to form
again their empire, but found the world too vast a
place - Ethron inhabitants of forest oaks, Dark
winged nefortu dangling in their dark places,
and even the alatharya of yore were returned in
diminished form. 

Still, for a time men formed a Republic on the
main continent of their home, but, in recent times,
these alliances were sundered by the raids of the
Kankoran barbarians and their allies. This has
resulted in the city states we see today -
Earandam the grand, Var Bandor, and even Ashta
Harrud, desert capitol of commerce. 

All races today find more meaning in finding their
own niche in the struggle for power, rather than a
great gasp at one empire. The Houses of Avendar
reflect this diversification of thought among the
people of Avendar. Likewise, the Scholars'
Towers, were even the mages of void and spirit
exist in an uneasy detente. 

Moreso than any time in history, the world is a
wide place, separated by long distances, with
opportunity awaiting around every street corner
in the great cities. A time, where, perhaps, the
future belongs to those who would take it, and
dare to tread the Siege Perilous - a time for
adventurers.....

Swordmasters, who spend their entire lives in the use of swords, are
in a unique position to appreciate the pecularities of a particular
weapon. After many long hours of use with a given type of sword, they
will often find a special insight into using that weapon in combat. 
Long hours are often required to gain this insight, but it justifies
the namesake of the swordmasters.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Unimpressed by the phalanx-shields of fighters, swordmasters have 
mastered the art of parrying with their secondary weapons. Swordmasters
operating on this level will find no need of a shield, instead 
substituting an equally useful parrying technique.

~

-1 'OFFHAND DISARM'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Swordmasters, with their intense focus on one particular type of weapon,
can become equally versatile with both hands. This will allow the 
swordmaster to maintain his form if his weapon is disarmed, along with
the swordmaster to assume a form, even if only his secondary weapon
is a sword.

Barbarians, with their primitive beliefs and exultation of the glories
of physical combat, will often take a trophy from their victim.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The Order of the Crown is a rigorist order of knights dedicated to the
principles of Iandir. Those who take the vows of the Crownbearer commit
themselves to a strict code of conduct, showing thereby their devotion
to Order and Law.
  Crownbearers may be good, neutral or evil, and may follow any House
affiliation, but must be lawful in ethos. A Crownbearer will usually
spend his life in pursuit of his own goals; however, he is expected to
bring Order to whatever that pursuit is, perhaps organizing a cause, or
leading a crusade.
  Followers of the Crown must comply with the following three principles:
1. Honesty. A Crownbearer must speak the absolute truth at all times, and
will never break his word.
2. Lawfulness. A Crownbearer lives in complete obedience to the Laws of
Avendar, and encourages others to do so as well.
3. Leadership. A Crownbearer recognizes that the essence of Order is the
organization of the forces of mankind, and applies the principles of
leadership to his endeavors.
  Iandir is currently in a state of semi-retirement, and is not taking
petitions for followers. Various lesser entities may be contacted for
membership in the Guardian house.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The followers of Arkhural, Bringer of the Twilight, know that within 
this world, there is only one true source of power, the ability to
instill fear within the hearts of men.  All other aspects of power, the
aggregation of material wealth, the control of political authority,
stems from this. Those that are weak, and succumb to fear themselves, 
are little more than mindless cattle, and are to be treated as such.
  The Arkhilhra, known collectively as the Sect of the Shijardu, are 
deemed by Arkhural to be superior to the rest of humanity.  As such, 
they are unrestrained by both moral and secular law, although these 
may be utilized as tools to control the masses.  Forever seeking to 
increase their power, they hold little value to oaths or treaties, 
dismissing such things when it suits them.  Relentless in the pursuit
of their goals, they fear nothing, save the unsatiated bloodlust of 
their God.
  Those that seek the attention of the Lord of the Twilight should 
address a note to Arkhural.  Be forewarned, those that are found 
unworthy shall find that the Lord of the Twilight's time is not to
be trifled with.

phoenix's power, it is said that the phoenix might even provide
some protection against the final death, but few scholars 
remain to bear witness to the veracity of this claim.

-1 DELAYED 'DELAYED BLAST FIREBALL'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Delayed Blast Fireball                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Delayed Blast Fireball' <Delay>

A more complicated version of the simple fireball spell, the delayed
blast fireball allows a fire scholar to ensorcel a room so that 
after a given amount of time has passed, a fireball will detonate in
a room. More powerful fire scholars can have more than one 
delayed blast fireball in use at a given time.

Acceptable values for delay are numbers between 1-7 (inclusive).

~


-1 DISINTEGRATION~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Disintegration                                             |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Disintegration' <Target>

An ferociously potent spell, disintegration is used by fire scholars
to inflict a large, fixed, and unavoidable amount of damage to the
target. Such is the power of the spell that victims may be
completely consumed by the spell. The power is such, though, that
disintegration may occasionally escape the control of the caster,
backblasting or disintegrating the caster! After casting the
spell, there is a substantial delay before it can be used again.

~

-1 'WINGS OF FIRE' 'WINGS OF FLAME'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Wings of Flame                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Wings of Flame'

This spell of fire allows the creation of flaming wings, which can
be used to hold the caster aloft. Due to the proximity and inherent
instability of the flames, however, the caster will take damage
on the average each hour from this spell. The wings also allow
a measure of quickness, allowing the caster to be more deft in
his or her movement.

~




-1 IMPLOSION~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Implosion                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

 Cast 'Implosion'

One of the most potentially devestating spells a scholar of fire
can cast, the implosion spell requires that the caster draw in
an immense amount of energy rapidly inward. In a split second,
the caster redirects the energy of the implosion to the
surrounding room, channeling the immense heat generated outward
in an exploding sphere. Such is the nature of the spell that
all in the room are affected, and the damage on each target
(including the caster!) is highly variable.

~

-1 'HEAT METAL'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Heat Metal                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Heat Metal' <Target>

A spell of the element of fire, the heat metal spell causes
the target's metal armor to begin to heat drastically in a short
period of time. The more metal the target is wearing, the more
damage is induced.

~



-1 'DIAMOND SKIN' DIAMOND DIAMONDSKIN~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Diamond Skin                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Diamond Skin'

The most powerful of scholars of earth may learn the diamond skin 
spell, which covers their skin in a hardened layer of diamond. While
under the influence of this spell, physical damage will have no effect
on the scholar. The spell is extremely short-lived, however, and 
so taxing is it that it cannot be cast in rapid succession.

~
-1 'WALL OF STONE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Wall of Stone                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Wall of Stone' <direction>

The wall of stone spell calls up a great wall of stone to block
off a given room's exit. The wall is of temporary duration, and
the spell can only be cast once a day.

~
-1 'STONE SHELL'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Stone Shell                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Stone Shell'

The stone shell spell encases the caster in a protective carapace
of stone, greatly improving his or her armor. The spell greatly
increases the cost of movement for the caster, but there is a 
small chance that weapons which hit the caster will sometimes splinter
and break.

~
-1 STABILIZE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|       Stabilize                                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Stabilize'

The stabilize spell roots the caster in the earth, preventing them from 
being bashed to the ground. The close connection to the earth can
also be used to block other attacks, such as a kick.

~
-1  'CALL UPON EARTH'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Call Upon Earth                                            |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Call Upon Earth'

Calling upon the strength and power of the earth, a skilled earth
magi may attempt to use this power to heal his or her wounds. 
This spell can only be cast underground, near to the heart of the
earth.

~


-1 'VOICE OF THE EARTH' 'VOICES OF THE EARTH' ~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Voice of the Earth                                         |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntaxt: Cast 'Voice of the Earth' <Target pc>

This spell attempts to divine the location of another person through 
the use of the intermediary of the power of earth. If the target is
on the surface of Avendar, the spell will reveal the type of terrain
the person is in. If the person is underground, the spell will reveal
the precise location of the target.

~


-1  DENSITY~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Density                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Density' <Target>

This spell of the element of earth drastically raises the density of a
target. Dense targets will find their ability to stand up, move, and
maintain their balance in combat adversely affected.

~


-1 'GRAVITY WELL'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|       Gravity Well                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Gravity Well'

One of the most wide-ranging spells of the element of earth, gravity
well changes the nature of gravity within a localized region of
Avendar. All flying creatures immediately tumble to the ground,
and flight becomes impossible. Movement costs treble in the affected
region, picking up and otherwise moving items becomes more difficult,
and large combatants will find it difficult to keep their footing
in combat.

~

-1 'SMOOTH TERRAIN'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|       Smooth Terrain                                                |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Smooth Terrain'

This spell smooths terrain about the caster as he or she walks, making
movement on almost any terrain as easy as travelling on a well travelled road.

~



-1 'FLESH TO STONE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Flesh to Stone                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Flesh to Stone' <Target>

This spell temporarily changes a target from flesh to stone. 
Targets encased in stone are immune to damage, but are incapable
of action.

~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Brittleform                                                |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Brittleform' <Target>

This spell makes the target's body more brittle, making them more 
vulnerable to blunt attacks. At the same type, this harder form is 
resistant to slashing types of damage.

~

-1 'SHAPE ARMOR'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Shape Armor                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Shape Armor' <Target Armor>

This spell of the sphere of earth attempts to make an item more
durable, giving it an (effective) bonus to the wearer's health. 
Continual attempts to strengthen armor may result in failure, or
the armor being destroyed. The spell is unlikely to succeed on
armor that already increases one's health.

~

-1 'SHAPE WEAPON'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Shape Weapon                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Syntax: Cast 'Shape Weapon' <Target Weapon>

This spell attempts to shape a weapon into doing more damage. One
of the byproducts of the spell is an increase in the weight of
the weapon. Casters should be wary of this spell, as repeated
attempts to shape a weapon may result in its destruction.

~


-1 'METAL TO STONE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Metal to Stone                                             |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Metal to Stone' <Target pc or weapon>

This spell from the element of earth attempts to transmute a metal
weapon to stone, greatly increasing its weight. The target can
either be an opposing player, or a weapon in the caster's inventory.
The effects of the spell are temporary.

Syntax: Cast 'Rune of Earth' <Direction>
        Cast 'Rune of Earth' <Container>

The rune of earth spell locks a given door or container, and magically

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Earth Elemental Summon                                      |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Earth Elemental Summon'

This spell calls an elemental to aid the caster. Elementals summoned
underground have more power, due to their close proximity to the
earth. Earth elementals cannot be summoned in the air, or in water.

~

-1 STRENGTHEN~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Strengthen                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Strengthen'

This spell temporarily strengthens an item, making it invulnerable
to such the deleterious effects of such spells as shatter or 
stone shell.

~


-1 'MELD WITH STONE'~

|        Meld with Stone                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Meld with Stone'

This spell allows the caster to blend into the earth, disappearing
completely from sight. As long as the caster does not move in any 
way, he or she is completely undetectable, and protected from various
offense area spells by the earth. The spell is taxing, however, and
requires a constant flow of mana to maintain. Should the caster
be unable to provide this mana, the spell will cease.

~


-1 'METEOR STRIKE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Meteor Strike                                               |

|        Crystalize Magic                                             |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Crystalize Magic'

One of the most powerful spells of the sphere of earth, crystalize
magic allows an earth scholar to create a shell of magic. The
first spell to target the earth scholar thereafter is absorbed
by the magic, and stored in the form of a magical crystal.
The crystal can then be evoked once to reproduce the spell which
targetted the earth scholar. Such is the magnitude of crystalize
magic that there it may only be cast periodically.

~



-1 'STONE TO MUD'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Stone to Mud                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Cast 'Stone to Mud'

This earth spell reduces the surrounding ground of the room completely

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Knock' <Direction>
        Cast 'Knock' <Container>

This spell manipulates the material of a locked door or container,
unlocking it. Not all locked doors or containers can be opened 
with the use of a knock spell, and there even exist spells which
may make knocking a door or object more difficult (see:
RUNE OF EARTH).

~


-1 'DISPEL ILLUSION'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Dispel Illusion                                             |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Dispel Illusion'

Calling on the opposition of forces present between earth and air,
a scholar of earth may attempt to dispel the illusions present in

Syntax: Night Vision

The night vision skill is learned by rogues to allow their eyes to 
adapt to the night, allowing them to discern things in an almost
total absence of illumination.

-1 'ROLEPLAYING GUIDELINES' 'RP GUIDELINES' GUIDELINES~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        ROLEPLAYING GUIDELINES                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

In order to aid you in understand what rolepaying is all about, here
are some of the more commonly occuring problems that people tend
to have. This list is by no means definitive, but by all means we
recommend that you keep these suggestions to heart.

-Quitting: By far the biggest abuse we often see (other than outright
 multicharring) is people who abuse their ability to quit. The quit
 command should be taken as your character holing up in a tavern,
 or returning to his private business away from their adventuring
 career. Thus, quitting to avoid in character consequences of
 your actions is *extremely* bad roleplaying, and should be avoided
 at all costs. This includes, but is not limited to, such as:
 (i)   Quitting immediately after pking someone. As a rule of thumb,
       wait until the other person's corpse has decayed.
 (ii)  Quitting to avoid being pked.
 (iii) Quitting to avoid any other sort of affects or spells. 

-The use of out of character things over open channels. Essentially,
 we feel that this spoils the 'mood' of the game world by constant
 references to real life things, numerical stats, and the like.
 You've been given an ooc command for this very reason, so please
 use it. 

-Getting carried away with playerkilling. Sure, it's fun to hunt and
 be hunted, but this shouldn't interfere with your roleplaying.
 Additionally, you should not be killing a person multiple times in
 a row without a good reason - remember that after you've killed
 someone, they really should be "dead" to you for a while. Good reasons
 include your target still posing a threat, stalking/insulting you, or
 still hanging on to their wordly posessions. Good reasons do not
 include "spite". As a rule of thumb, wait at least an hour before
 attacking the same PC (unless given cause).

-Putting your character's advancement over your in character goals.
 Simply put, your character shouldn't violate his or her beliefs
 to get an in game advantage. Over course, certain alignments and
 ethoi focus on their own advancement (i.e., expect evil people to
 be bastards). We try to balance this things by giving good people
 commands like request.

-Allowing other people to share your character/password/etc. 
 It is unacceptable to allow friends to play your character,
 as they are generally incapable of fitting the role you 
 design for yourself. (And if your role is so poorly developed
 that they *could*, that's a problem too!). So, don't share your
 character with anyone.

Violating any of the above may be grounds for disciplinary action on
behalf of the imm staff. While we recognize there may be certain
subjective and vague areas in roleplaying the sort of rich
and complicated characters we like to see, we will be vigilant
for gross violations of the rules and the above guidelines
(particularly things like abuse of the quit command). Try your
best to get a coherent description for your character, and
to get a feel for what your character would do in a given
situation, and you should do fine.

~


-1 ADRENALINE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Adrenaline                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

After fighting, and particularly after running from combat, you will
find that you will be unable to quit and leave Avendar due to your
body's natural adrenaline. This feature exists to discourage you
from quitting to avoid the consequences of your actions.

~

-1 NAME NAMES~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Names                                                        |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

When you enter Avendar, you should realize that you are assuming
the role of a fantasy character (as outlined in help ROLEPLAYING).
In keeping with this notion, you should choose your name accordingly.
Your name should be an appropriate for a fantasy roleplaying
environment. Here are a few guidelines to help you along the way:

-The name should not be a dictionary word

Reason: This is a fantasy world. We aren't really meant to be 
speaking English. If you want your name to mean something, dream up
a word and say that it means this in the fantasy language of your
choice. Names like "Twist" or "Claw" don't add anything to
the experience - rather, they indicate a fixation on the 
ordinary.

-The name should not be a recognizable character in an existing
work of fantasy. Avendar is an original world, so we expect the
characters in that world to vie for originality as well. It's also
very disconcerting to see Elrond the barbarian, Gandalf
the shuddeni swordmaster, or Rand the Srryn bandit

-The name should be appropos for a fantasy setting. This means we'd
like to avoid such real life names as "Bob" or "Joe", and instead 
focus of names more suited for quality in a fantasy world. This also
includes names in other langagues that aren't suited to Avendar. 
(i.e., names like "el chupacabra", etc.)

If you're having a problem dreaming up names, consider checking out
EBON: The Ever Changing Book of Names, located at
http://www.utu.fi/-sapyorre/ebon/ 
(That - = a tilda....), which is a superb(!) program for Win 95. The
page also has links to other name generators, if you have a machine
that doesn't support EBON.

In the future we'll be offering EBON files for each of the major
languages of Avendar, so  you can get a feel for the languages.
(We even use EBON to help us name some of our own mobs)

If the immortals find your name inappropriate, you will be asked
to change it. Rather than having to do this, however, try to
adhere to the guidelines given above, and spare us all some time.

-1 ALIGNMENT2~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Alignment2                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

To give you an idea how various alignments behave, here are a series of
hypothetical scenarios, and some typically responses from various 
alignments/ethoi:

Suppose that a party of adventurers come upon a town, which is being
raided by goblins from a nearby dungeon. The townsfolk, in dire need
of help, beg the adventurers for assistance. 

A lawful good would probably agree whole-heartedly. Towns and cities
provide the most protection from the innocent, and therefore need
to be defended. He or she would probably help the townsfolk organize
their defenses in a more coordinated way. Failing this, he would try
to organize retaliatory strikes against the goblins.

A neutral good person would also agree, but might consider more options.
He might be more concerned with directly fighting the goblins (such
as leading his group to fight them), rather than protecting the
fabric of the town itself.

A chaotic good person would agree, but we might go about the problem
in radically different ways. He would be far more concerned with
getting rid of the evil threat (goblins), than he would be protecting
the laws and walls of the township. Their means of finacing their
quest might be a touch unorthodox as well - stealing from evil citizens
of the town, or a wily plan to trap the goblins.

A lawful neutral person would probably do what he could to protect
the town. The preparations he employed might be similar in form
to that of the lawful good person, but he would be more concerned
with protecting the integrity of the town and its capacity to function
as a society, rather than individual innocent lives.

A true neutral person would be inclined to consider the offer very
carefully. He would most likely be more concerned as to the reasons
for the goblins raiding. Has the town recently infringed on the
territory of the goblins? Or have the goblins grown out of control
recently? The answer to these questions will heavily influence the
nature of the response. They might prefer not to intervene, not
wishing to upset the delicate balance that might exist between
the townsfolk and the goblins. Or, they might decide goblin
in the activity in the region is too high, and needs to be curbed.
They might even see that the townsfolk are being too aggressive in
their exploitation of the world around them, and *they* are the ones
who need to be foiled.

A chaotic neutral person's response is perhaps the most difficult
to predict. They would most likely go along with the opportunity
for further adventure, but if the person had been doing a lot of
goblin hunting lately, the prospect of helping the townsfolk might
not appeal to him. He might, for a lark, side with the goblins if they
would have him - not out of malice, but merely for a change of pace!


A lawful evil person would look for appealing methods to turn the
situation to his advantage. He certainly would only help the 
townspeople fight off or attack the goblins if some reward or other
sort of compensation were offered. Depending on the predilictions
of the person in question, they might even take this opportunity
to try to insinuate himself into a position of power within the
township. And, if the opportunity presented himself, he might
also not be averse to assembling and controlling a goblin army . . .

A neutral evil person would size the situation up carefully.
Which side would have the most to offer him - the townsfolk,
or the goblins? Who is most likely to win? Would it be more 
profitable to just sit back and let them fight it out, and take
on whatever faction was left in the end? Regardless, the neutral
evil person's actions would be completely motivated by their own
self interest, with no concern for the others involved.

A chaotic evil person would most likely side with the goblins if
at all possible. The idea of aiding someone just because they
asked them (an admission of weakness) would probably be anathema 
to them. While if a large reward were proferred they might attempt
to destroy the goblin, but they would be more likely to try to
pocket the money and run, or let the goblins burn the town, then
kill the goblins.

-1 ALIGNMENT ETHOS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Alignment and Ethos                                        |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Characters in Avendar choose both an alignment and an ethos upon 
creation.

Your ALIGNMENT is a measure of your character's moral compass.
Your alignment can be good, neutral, or evil.

If your character is . . . 

GOOD, he or she will tend to not place their own interests above
those of others. 

NEUTRAL, he or she will tend to not take a firm moral stance.
They might choose to distance themselves between the turmoil that
surrounds the fight between good and evil, or to crusade actively
to promote a measure of balance.

EVIL, he or she will tend to act in whatever they perceive as
their own best interest, regardless of the cost to others.


ETHOS:

Your ethos determines their attitude toward laws and
the nature of society.
Your ethos can be lawful, neutral, or chaotic.

If your character is . . . 

LAWFUL, he or she will tend to follow the established rule of
law. Lawful characters are typified by the idea that for whatever
reason, society should in general be governed by a code of laws,
and that they personally should do their best to exist within
the confines of these laws.

NEUTRAL, he or she is indifferent to the laws and rules of society.
There actions and attitudes toward the laws will depend more on
their other beliefs rather than any explicit opinion for or against
the law. 


CHAOTIC, he or she the laws of society as a whole as a hindrance
to their beliefs or goals in life. Chaotic individuals tend
therefore to place more importance on the ideas and opinions of
individuals, and to place their faith more in chance and fortune
rather than order and pattern.

-1 'BECOMING AN IMMORTAL'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Becoming an Immortal                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Characters who have reached the 51st rank ("hero-rank") may petition
to become an immortal.

The job of immortal is not one embarked upon lightly. It requires
an enormous amount of patience, and having the sense of self to handle
long hours of thankless work and/or abuse from the people above and
below you. 

This being said, these are the things we tend to look for in applicants:

-Creativity: Nothing is more important than the capacity to create
 new ideas. 

-Roleplaying: Your character should have to demonstrate the ability
 to not only play a fantasy role, but also to play one -well-.

-Knowledge of the World: Your character should have acquired a 
 certain level of understanding of the way the world works, 
 the classes do/do not balance, and what is/is not possible 
 with the class they've played to hero.

-Participation: We want to see characters who have gone out of 
 their way to contribute to the world that is Avendar. This 
 includes things such as being a part of quests, accomplishing
 your own character's goals with respect to the world, and 
 overall being a part of the overreaching conflicts in the
 world.

Now, as for the application process itself, after you have become a
hero, and you think you're ready, here's that you need to do.

Step I: Write an Application

Your application is a note you write to immortal. The note should 
be out of character. When writing your application, try to answer
the following questions:

-Why do you want to be an immortal?
-What do you think you have to offer the imm staff here at Avendar? 
-How long have you mudded? What sort of experiences do you have
 elsewhere, either as an immortal or as a player?
-How do you think your character's role has changed from its
 original inception? How do you think you've fulfilled the goals
 set out for your characters?
-What's your vision of the future of Avendar? What would you like
 to change, if you could, and how would you go about changing it?

Once you've answered these questions, you should include your
design for an area for Avendar. This doesn't have to be anything
super detailed, but it will serve to let us get an idea of your
creative potential, along with what sort of ideas you have. 
This are isn't necessarily the first are you will write, and may
never be created at all, but having an idea that we -would- consider
using goes a long way. In fact, the more thought you put into this,
the more impressed we will be with your application in general. 

Finally, you can insert whatever other things you feel are important
to your application. You can include things like signifigant 
accomplishments, a history of your time here on Avendar, or the like.

Now, once you've done all this and sent it in a note to IMMORTAL,
wait for our decision.

If we like what we see, you'll go on to Step 2. If we don't like
what we see, we'll try to tell you what our problem with you or your
application was. Only in exceptional circumstances will you be 
allowed to reapply with this character. If you didn't succeed,
try to remember that it takes a lot of time and experience, and
not everyone has the fanaticism or dedication it takes to run a MUD.

Step 2: The Interview

If we've found your application satisfactory, we'll arrange an
interview between you and the Implementors, along with what other
immortals have an interest in your case.

The interview is meant to be a final trial by fire of the soul of
the applicant. The interview will be out of character, but do 
expect to defend any and everything about the role your character
has played. Expect questions about your ideas and opinions, as 
well as questions about your proposed areas. 

If you survive the interview with your soul intact, you will
then become an immortal.

If you do not survive the interview, the discarded husk of your ego
will be returned to the real world, where you will gibber the
Truths of Elder Things madly until the end of your days.

Good Luck!

-1 REALISM REALITY~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Realism                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

A natural question that arises in the construction of any artificial 
gaming universe is what degree of realism one wishes to impose on
thid universe.

It is our contention that the proper attitude to employ is neither
a slavish devotion to 'realism for realism's sake' nor a complete 
abandonment of the idea that we are in the business of creating 
a cohesive fantasy environment, but rather, we should strive for
a "suspension of disbelief" that is so coveted in other media.

Our goal is to create a world that abstracts the essence of a 
grand fantasy. Imagine your favorite work of fiction (most particularly
a work of fantasy), and the odds of part of why you enjoy it is that
it draws you in s very wonderful way into the author's world.

Imagine walking the halls of the Mines of Moria, or a force march
across the Blight, seeing the world from the back of a flying Tarn,
or even riding into battle with the knights of the round table. 
Take those emotions, and those experiences, and that strikes at 
the essence of what we're trying to create, except we hope to 
make our _own_ world, where people can have these sorts of adventures.

The realism that we have tried to incorporate into the world is 
a slave to the larger goals outlined above. Realism isn't pursued
as a thing in and of itself - rather, as a means to the end of 
immersing people in a role-playing fantasy experience. Of course,
this means making things a challenge for players - it wouldn't
be much of a story if the villain is defeated on the first page, 
and there is no test or trial by fire of the souls of the heroes.

Contrawise, we want our players to be concerned with great things,
not petty ones. That's why we don't make you worry about obscure
things like the effect of your character's bathing habits on the
price of bread, or when the last time you stopped fighting monsters
to take a bathroom break. We try to minimize tedium, and maximize
interesting and neat things. (A never-ending process, we might add!

In short, we aim at at a realism that is fantastic rather than mundane,
and one that strives to be wonderful rather than petty, refined 
rather than vulgar - and we hope we enjoy your travels here.

-1 IMMORTAL IMMORTALS IMMORT GOD GODS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Immortal                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The immortals, or "imms" as they are sometimes known, are the 
creators and maintainers of the MUD. The immortals are characters of
the 52nd rank are higher. They cannot be killed by mortals, and
have a wide variety of powers, depending on their position in the
hierarchy (with level 60 immortals, or Implementors as they are 
known, at the top). 

The immortals perform a large number of functions for the MUD, but 
they can be categorized into two chief domains:

I. In Character Functions:

In character, the immortals represent the gods of the world, embodying
timeless virtues, vices, principles, ideals, forces, and elements.
Immortals of the 53rd rank or higher have religions, with active 
followings in the world. As such, the gods are responsible for 
ensuring that their followers carry out the tenets of their ideals 
in the mortal realms. The gods are those who use the mortal realm of
Avendar as a proving ground for their own philosophies and fights, 
and have corresponding powers.

II. Out of Character Functions

The immortals are the people who have created and will continue to 
create the world of Avendar. Immortals are the people who 'build' 
the areas that make up the world. Immortals are also people who 
design the classes and code the skills/spells used by the players.
The immortals also run quests to further immerse, intrigue, inveigle,
and otherwise bring delight to the players. Immortals are also the 
people who make sure the rules of the MUD are enforced.


Some tips on dealing with immortals:

-Remember in your interactions with the imms that ic they are as close
to all-powerful beings as your players will ever see. If you are
with a god, treat him accordingly, or expect a negative reaction
(which can vary depending on the mood/type of deity you're dealing
with).

-When reporting a bug or problem, try to be as accurate and specific
as possible. Report all the relevant details of your problem. Try
not to get upset or be impatient - the immortals are people too, 
and often deal with multiple bug reports of the same bug, often 
each from a more incensed player than the last. I.e., politeness
goes a long way.

-If you are attempting to contact a god in character, you will have
the most luck from shrines, temples, or other holy places dedicated
to that god. Gods will be more likely to arrange an audience for them,
particularly if you follow the guidelines they recommend in their 
help file.

-If you are caught breaking or attempting to break a rule, honesty
is often the best policy. Trying to lie about what you did will
often result in a harsher penalty, and a more irate immortal.
We do keep logs of the major player commands (such as attacking
other players, logging in/out, etc.), so dishonesty is definitely
*not* the best policy.

Finally, you may wonder how new immortals are created. If you
think you have what it takes and are interested in becoming an
immortal, see the help file BECOMING AN IMMORTAL

-1 DUAL 'DUAL WIELD'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Dual Wield                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The ability to dual wield is a skill which classes with at least some
devotion to fighting may master. As its name it implies, it allows the
user to attempt to wield two weapons at once. In order for this two
occur, the following must be true: You must be wielding a weapon in
your "main hand", and have your other hand free (not carrying a held
item. etc.). You then must attempt the second weapon. If the weapons
are compatible, the second weapon will automatically go into your off
hand. If the weapons or not compatible, the second weapon will replace
the first. Compatiblity depends on a number of factors, but a good rule
is that to ensure the proper balance, the second weapon must be two-thirds
the weight of the first. Certain small weapons, such as daggers, are an
exception to this rule. Giant sized races, such as the alatharya, may be
able to dual some two-handed weapons due to their enormous sizes. 
Your skill at dual wield will determine how often you are successfully
able to use your second weapon to hit.

-1 MARLAX HONOR 'WHITE FALCON' 'TYRANT OF HONOR' 'FALCON KING'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Marlax                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Note: The Falcon King Marlax is not presently receiving active
followers, as he is on sabbatical from the realms.

Marlax the Tyrant of Honor, Falcon King
"MARLAX" "HONOR" "WHITE" "FALCON"
 
A bearer of the white falcon upholds honor as his or her chief virtue.  
They are self-reliant; they can defeat many foes alone.  While advancing,
they may travel with others, but fighting other adventurers requires even 
odds. They are trustworthy; they will not break their word, and always 
follow any conditions agreed to, regardless of circumstances.  Greed for 
material wealth is frowned upon by those of the white falcon; they take 
only what is needed, and return what is not to the defeated foe.  They 
will not attack an unclad foe, unless they must retaliate against an attack.  
They will only take what they gained in fair combat; theft of this kind 
is severely frowned upon.  Even if your friend is attacked, and slain, 
you must not take from their corpse, unless they were slain in dishonor.  
Finally, they will try to even out odds, if they see many fighting one, 
unless the one is a blood enemy.  Honor is the fundamental issue in their 
victories, whether against evil, or good, or those who don't take such 
sides.

-1 EXOTIC EXOTICS 'EXOTIC WEAPONS'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Exotic Weapons                                             |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Along with the other major weapon classes in Avendar, some weapons
can not be easily categorized. These weapons, known as exotic type weapons,
can be anything from a net to a rare and unique magical weapon. Most
adventurers will not be automatically be skilled in exotics, requiring
a mastery of their craft before they attain proficiency in them. For
gladiators, however, who train in such exotic styles of fighting in their
arena duels, skill in exotic weapons comes naturally.

~

-1 WEAPON WEAPONS 'WEAPON TYPES'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Weapons                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The following are the various types of weapons you may find in Avendar:

Axe
Dagger
Exotic
Flai
Mace
Polearm
Spear
Staff
Sword
Whip

To learn more about a given weapon, consult the corresponding help file.
~


-1 SWORD SWORDS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Swords                                                      |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Swords are perhaps the most common of weapons in Avendar, known and
used by all professions save those of the scholars and druids. A sword
typically consists of a hilt (place to hold the sword), a crossbar,
and a blade. Blade lengths can be anywhere from 2' to 8', with the
very largest swords usable only by the giant races. Blades on swords
can either be one or two-sided, curved, straight, or even barbed to
inflict more lasting damage. Usually, a sword will inflict stabbing,
slashing, chopping, cutting, piercing, or cleaving damage. Swords have
traditionally been the weapon of choice for enchantments and other 
such magics. 

~
-1 DAGGER DAGGERS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Daggers                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Daggers are short bladed weapons, most commonly used by the rogueish
classes and those of scholarly bent who lack the time to learn more
complicated weapons. Dagger attacks usually involve quick thrusting,
piercing or stabbing attacks. Daggers offer very little in the way
of parrying, but their quick speed makes them hard to dodge.

~



-1 MACE MACES~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Maces                                                      |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

A mace is a blunt weapon, consisting of a block of metal attached to
a shaft, occasionally covered with spikes or edges to do more damage.
Maces usually attack with crushes or pounds, and are often employed by
barbarians, who are known for using their ferocious bludgeoning
attacks. Maces are also occasionally employed by footman, or the occasional 
scholar or templar.

~

-1 WHIP WHIPS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Whips                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

A whip consists of a flexible cord attached to a handle. The cord can
be made from any number of materials, but is most commonly leather.
Oft times, other sharp materials (such as glass or bits of metal) may
be embedded in the cord to inflict more damage. Whips are most commonly
used by gladiators (who are known for their exotic lashing and disarming
techniques), but also see some usage among some templars and
scholars.

~

-1 FLAIL FLAILS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Flails                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Flails are a rather uncommon class of weapon, used by and large by 
gladiators. Similar to a whip, a flail also consists of a handle and
a cord. Unlike the whip, however, the cord is not a single lash - it
instead links a series of objects together. These objects are typically
balls of metal, usually with with some sort of spikes or other sharp
protrusions designed to inflict damage.

~

-1 POLEARM POLEARMS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|             Polearms                                                |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

A polearm is a blade of some form attached to a long (typically at
least 6' or more) pole. The attached blade may be akin to a sword,
axe, or more exotic design. Polearms are typically used to keep a foe
at a foe at a distance while striking with the blade.  Polearms are
favored by fighters, who often train in their use, both due to their,
reach, and their good parrying ability.
~
-1 STAFF~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Staff                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The staff is the most common two-handed weapon, most typically made 
from wood into a long pole. The staff is typically used to pound,
strike, or crush an opponent. Its long shaft allows for easy parrying
of blows, for which the staff is used primarily as a defensive weapon.
Due to its focus on defending against blows, the staff is often a
favorite weapon among scholars.

~
-1 SPEAR SPEARS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Spears                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

A spear is a long shaft topped by a sharpened tip. The shaft of a 
spear may also occasionally be barbed to inflict more damage. 
The attack of a spear is typically a pierce, stab, or impaling jab,
and the weapon is favored by gladiators, who often use the spear
to strike at vital organs. The spear is also occasionally used
by barbarians, and fighters, who are often trained in organized
phalanxes.  The parrying ability of the spear is second only to that
of the staff.
~
-1 AXE AXES~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|             Axes                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Axes are primarily offense weapons, most favored by the barbarians
for its sheer ferocity. Axes come in many varieties (both one handed
and two), but most all consist of a short shaft topped by either one
or two wedge-like blades, occasionally topped with a spike. Axes
usually slash, slice, cleave or chop in their attacks.

~




-1 HAND 'HAND TO HAND'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Hand to Hand                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The ability to use one's bare hands to inflict more damage than normal
is a skill known to adventurers in Avendar. The skill is automatically
attempted whenever no weapons are being used, and will cause these
blows to inflict more damage than normal.

~

-1 'FLOATING DISC' 'FLOATING DISK'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Floating Disc                                                |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Floating Disc'

The floating disc spell calls into existence an invisible disc of 
air. The disc will float by the caster for the duration of the spell,
on which items can be placed. The duration and weight allownace of
the disc depend on the level of the caster. Upon termination of the
spell, the disc will vanish, causing any items on it to tumble to the
ground. The spell requires that the caster be free of other floating
items to be successful.

~

-1 RECALL~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Recall                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Syntax: RECALL (or /)

RECALL prays to the gods for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the appropriate temple of your hometown.  

'/' is a synonym for RECALL.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

You may not recall from the middle of battle, or while your adrenaline
is gushing from combat.

Only characters of level less than 10 may use the automatic recall 
command. Other characters will have to find magical or other means 
to return themselves to recall to their hometown.

~



-1 KILL~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Kill                                                        |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Kill <Target>

The kill command has two functions. Firstly, it allows a player to 
initiate combat with a mobile.

The second use is in a fight with multiple participants. If a character
is being attacked by more than one person, he can switch who he targets
his blows toward by typing "kill <target>". Thusly, if someone is 
fighting a bear and a hen, to switch from striking at the bear to 
striking at the hen, type "kill hen". Kill cannot be used to draw in a
mob or person that is not already fighting if the character is already
otherwise engaged in a fight.

~

-1 HIDE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Hide                                                         |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Hide

The hide command is used by rogues to seclude themselves within the
shadows. Hiding can only be attempted in civilized locales, and any
attempt to move while hidden will result in stepping out of the 
shadows unless the person hiding is currently sneaking. (See help
SNEAKING). The nature of hide is that a rogue attempting the skill
will not know whether he or she is successful - they must rely on
their ability to gauge the reactions of others to determine whether
or not they are succesfully hidden.

~

-1 CHAIN 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Chain Lightning                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Chain Lightning' <Target>

A stereotypically chaotic and ucontrolled spell of the school of air,
chain lightning is an offensive spell, designed to inflict electrical
damage on a foe. When the spell is cast, a long electrical arc hits
the victim, then bounces about the room, hitting every available 
target, not excluding the mage who cast the spell.

~


-1 LORE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        LORE                                                         |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Lore <Item>

Bards, who make careers out of recording the history and lore of
people, places, and things, can use this knowledge to good advantage
when attempting to ascertain information about an object. Along
with the more basic items of an item, the bard may occasionally
learn more about the object's history.

~




-1 SNEAK~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|       Sneak                                                         |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Sneak

The sneak skill is used to move silently. It has several visible 
affects. Firstly, when used in conjunction with the hide command
(see help HIDE), it allows someone to move without stepping out of the
shadows. Secondly, it allows objects to be taken from the room without
arosing suspicion. Finally, even for those not hiding, it allows exit
from a room to go unnoticed.

~

-1 'HERBAL MEDICINE' HERBAL~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|      Herbal Medicine                                                |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Herbal <Target (Optional)>

Herbal medicine may be prepared by a druid as a healing aid. At higher
levels of druidical power, the medicine may also be used in an attempt
to cure poison or plague. Herbal medicine may only be concocted in the
forests.

~



-1 DEATH DYING~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|      Death                                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of 
the Temple of your home city.  Your corpse is left behind in the room 
where you were killed, together with all of your equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are cancelled by death, but 
following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is dependent
on your current level.

You may also lose vitality (constitution) when you die. If you did lose
constitution, a scholar of water might be able to help you with the
ressurect spell, which has a chance to restore lost con.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with 
them. Player corpses last *roughly* 15 hours of game time (15 minutes of 
real time). After the corpses decay, your items will return to the altar
you recall to in your home town.

After your death, you will return as a ghost. You will remain a
ghost until you return to a healer in town (and use the 
'Heal Resurrect' command), or are resurrected by a water scholar.
Ghosts are automatically given pass door, flying, and the
ability to see in the dark. Ghosts are also immune to being
attacked, and cannot initiate combat or use hostile magic and
skills of any kind. Ghosts can loot possessions from their
own corpse, but are unable to take any other items.

After level 10, you must remain a ghost a minimum of five minutes
before being resurrected. After twenty minutes as a ghost, your
constitution will begin to slowly drain away. When it reaches 3,
you will perish again, this time losing a point of vitality.
This means that once your corpse has decayed to the altar, it is
always to your advantage to return to the temple.

Each time you die, there is a chance you can lose constitution.
For more info, see help CON DEATH.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Whenever your character dies, there is a chance you will lose a point 
of constitution. Should your constitution ever fall below four, your
character will die permanently. After this, you will walk the lands
a brief time as a ghost. Following this period, your character will
disappear entirely, so make the most of this time to bid your final
farewells.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

MUD is short for Multi-User Dungeon, and it's what you're on now.
Basically, it's an computer universe where you interact with a 
constructed world and other players, all of whom have connected to this
game through the use of the Internet.

|      Experience                                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Your character advances in power by gaining experience. The amount of
experience you need to advance a level will increase as your level
increases.


You gain experience by:

    Being part of a group that kills a monster
    Gaining mastery of a skill
    Completing certain quests or tasks
 
You lose experience by:

    Fleeing from combat
    Being the target of certain spells
    Dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; 
your alignment versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster 
have been killed lately; and some random variation.

Here in Avendar, there is an experience bonus for working in a group.
You will receive the optimum amount of experience with a group of 
three, although groups of four or two have been known to be effective.

Additionally, there are some monsters of great power which will take
you much longer to kill than regular foes. If you are successful in
slaying such beasts, you may find that you learn substantially more
experience than is the typical norm.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Trip <Target>

The trip command attempts to bring an opponent down by knocking their
feet from under them. Tripping is most successfully practiced by the
quick and nimble, and fails on opponents who are flying or otherwise
not tied to the ground. Trip can either be used to start a fight, or
in combat, where the argument is optional.

|           Starting                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

As a newly arrived adventurer in Avendar, there are
probably a few things that will come to your attention
starting out.

Q: How do I move around?

A: You can move in one of six directions:
North, south, east, west, up, and down

To move in these directions, type the direction you want to go.

Ex: To go north, type:

North

Q: What if I run into a door?

A: If the door is unlocked, you simply type: 

Open <door's name> 

to open it.

If it's in a particular direction (let's say north), you can type:

Open north

to open it.


If the door is locked, you need to either find some magical way
of going through it, or get the key to the door. Once you DO get
the key, you can unlock the door by typing:

Unlock <door's name>

or

Unlock <direction>


--------------


Q: How do I talk?

A: To say something aloud to the other people in the room,
use the "say" command. 

Example: To say to the room that you're a gladiator, type:

say I'm a gladiator

To send a message to another person, so only they can hear it,
use the "tell" command.

Example: To tell a person named Jolinn that you're a gladiator,
type:

tell Jolinn I'm a gladiator - can you point me to an arena?

Note: For tell to work, two things need to be true:

(a) The person you send the tell to must be logged in.
(b) The person must be visible to you

If you want to _respond_ to a tell, use the "reply" command:

Ex:

If Jolinn tells you 'Any spares?'

You can type:

reply You're a god! Why are you whining for spares?

And it will respond with a tell to Jolinn. The nice part about the reply
command is that you don't need to be able to see the person you're
responding to. This makes it easy to keep contact with friends who might
be hiding themselves magically or through some other method.

Now, in a similar fashion, if you want to send an out of character
message to someone, use the "ooc" command.

Example: To ooc someone that you've got to leave, type:

ooc Jolinn I can't stay - my thesis defense is in 20 minutes!

Just like tell, you need to be able to see the person, and the
person needs to be logged in.

To communicate in a more public fashion, you probably want to use
the "yell" command. Yelling things is like shouting something - everyone
around can hear it. Yelled phrases can be heard everywhere in the
surrounding area (help AREAS) that you're in. In general, unless you
want to irritate everyone in the area, use the yell command sparingly.

Ex of a good yell:
Type:

yell A yithoul dagger for sale, going for 15k gold!

Ex of a bad yell:
Type:

Yell Any sparez?!?!?


Finally, if you absolutely, positively, have to get in touch with the 
immortals, use the "pray" command. NOTE: Read help pray before using
this command. Also, read help pray2.

If you want to pray to an immortal, the syntax is:

Pray <message>

Ex of a Good Pray:

Pray I think I've found a bug with this swordmaster skill.

Ex of a Bad Pray:

Pray He d00dz can I have some el1te sparez!?!?!

Essentially, you should only use pray to report bugs, or to report
observed instances of cheating.



Now that you know the very basics, (getting around and communicating),
you're ready for the next part of the basics, found in the help
file STARTING2

~

-1 STARTING2~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Starting, Part 2                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Let's start with the short term things:

Equipping yourself.

To survive, you're probably going to need some equipment.
From the magic mouth where you first arrive, if you head
two north, you'll find yourself at a representative of
the school. If you read the sign ("look sign"), you'll get
some free equipment to get you started.

Don't forget to also get the maps, which will help you get your bearings.

Feeding yourself:

You start the game with 50 gold pieces. The easiest place to buy
food, and a container for water is in the school of heroes. 

If you absolutely must get to the food in the school, here
are the directions from the Magic Mouth at the entrance to the school:

10 north, open north, 2 north, down, east, 2 down, 6 north, 2 east

Your best bet is to stock up on iron rations, and obtain a jug of water.

If you've graduated from the school, and find yourself starving, from
the recall point in Var Bandor:

South, 2 east, 4 south, 4 west, 3 south, east

Remember, the command to buy food is:

Buy <Food item>

In the case of the mercenary in the school, you type:

Buy iron

To eat the food, try: Eat <item>

In the case of the iron rations, it's:

Eat iron

If you're thirsty, you should drink from your jug. Use
Drink <container> or Drink <fountain in the room>

In the case of the jug, type:

Drink jug

Once you get a jug, you might want to fill it with water from a fountain
if you drink all the water out of it.

An easy to get to fountain is:

South, 2 east 

of the Var Bandor recall point.

To fill your jug, type:

Fill jug.

Now that you've gotten your equipment and food, you're ready to make 
your way in the world. Now, you're ready to make your way into the world!

Well, almost. First, you should learn about practicing and training
your skills. To do this, read help STARTING3

~
-1 STARTING3~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Starting, Part 3                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


An important of playing your character is knowing what skills, spells,
and other powers you have available, and know how to use them. 

Firstly, to get a list of the skills you have, type:

Skills

If you're a class with magic, look at your spells by typing:

Spells

These lists give you a list of what skills/spells you have, and
what level you're able to use your spells or skills. 

Most of the spells/skills in these lists has help files, so consult
these for specifics.

However, to take advantage of these skills and spells, you need to 
practice them. To do this, you must go to your guildmaster.

To get to the guilds from the magic mouth, go:

10 north, open north, 2 north, down

This will take you to the hall of guilds, from which you can practice.

Now, let's take an example. Let's suppose you're a barbarian.
From where you entered the hall, you would go east and north, and
find yourself at the barbarian guildmaster.


Now, to learn your skills, you need to practice them.
Type "practice". You should see:

axe                  40% flail                1%  mace                 1%  
spear                1%  sword                1%  enhanced damage      1%  
fast healing         1%  
You have 5 practice sessions left.

This is a list of spells available to you as a level 1 barbarian.

Starting out, you probably want to use a weapon, so it's a good idea
to practice axe.

Type: 

Practice axe

Your axe skill will increase in an amount *depending on your intelligence*.
The most you can ever practice a given spell or skill is to 75%.

As you advance in level, you will obtain more practices. The number
of practices you get *depends on your wisdom*.

Now, you might have also noticed that your character has certain
statistics when you rolled. If you look at the help on STATS, you can
find out what each of your stats is reponsible for. 

Now, the way you normally go about increasing your stats is through the
use of TRAINS. (See help TRAINS) You can train at the same guildmaster
you practiced at. If you type "train" you should see a list of what's
available to train.

Typing train, you should see something similar to:

You have 3 training sessions.
You can train: str int wis dex con hp mana.

You begin the game with three training sessions.

As you advance in level, you will acquire a new training session every
five levels. 

So, to train a stat, type:

Train <stat>

Ex:

Train con

It's a good idea to train your wisdom and constitution early, since
they affect the number of practices you obtain per level, and the number
of hit points.

Ok, now that you've learned about practicing and training, you've done
most of the preparing you need. Now, it's time to learn about fighting,
and some survival tips. For this information, read help STARTING4

~

-1 STARTING4~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Starting, Part 4                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Now that you've learned how to move around, communicate, feed yourself,
and practice and train skills, you should now learn about how combat
works.

In your travels in Avendar, you will come upon many monsters. Some will be peaceful, and others aggressive. To kill a creature, use the "kill" 
command.

Example: Suppose you see:

A small lizard is chained to the ground here.

To attempt to kill the lizard, type:

kill lizard

In the fight, if you get in trouble, you might want to try the "flee" command, 
in an attempt to escape. You will flee in a random direction. 

Be warned: Many monsters will follow you, attempting to track you down. 
In order to escape, you may need to employ some magical means of transportation.

One example of this is the RECALL command, which characters of less than
10 th level may use. 

To recall, simply type:

Recall

This will take you back to an appropriate temple in your home town.

Now, when you kill something, you get experience (help EXPERIENCE) for it.
As you gain experience, you will eventually progress in levels.

The best way to get experience, however, is not through killing things
by yourself. As you will learn if you read the experience help file,
you learn more experience from joining a group, optimally one with
three people. 

To join a group, you follow the leader of the group. The "follow" command
will allow you to do this. If, for instance, Jolinn is leading a group,
you would type:

Follow Jolinn

and then Jolinn could add you to his group.

If you're leading a group, use the "group" command to remove or add
someone to your group. Suppose Jolinn is following you. To add him to
your group, you would type:

Group Jolinn

If at any time you don't want to have any followers, type
"nofollow" or "nof" for short. 

To see the status of the people in your group, use the "group" command
by itself. 

If you want to tell your groupmates something, use the "grouptell"
(gt for short) command. This will display a message to only the other
members of your group.

---  

Finally, once you know how to group with people, how do you know where
to go? Well, uses the AREAS command to get a list of areas that are
appropriate for your level range. 

A few good places to start:

-The Tower of Challenges (one south of the magic mouth)
-The merchants around the docks of Var Bandor (if you're good)
-Dogs and Children in Krilin (if you're evil)

Above all, look around, explore, and try asking around, or just
learning by travelling with others.

Best of luck adventuring in Avendar!

|       Limited Equipment                                             |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The best equipment here on Avendar is limited. This means there are
a limit to the number of these items that can exist in the world at
any given time. This means that if a mob starts out with the piece of
equipment, if you keep killing the mob, eventually the equipment won't
come back until a piece of this equipment has been destroyed elsewhere.
Due to the power of limited equipment, those below level 10 cannot retain
the equipment if they quit, and it cannot be stored in containers.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Air Rune'

The air rune is used by scholars of the element of air to completely 
disguise the presence of them and their party. While the magic is 
complete in its security, any motion at all will disturb the illusion
of the spell.
~



-1 SUCTION~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Suction                                                      |

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Windwalk' <Target>

The windwalk spell allows the skilled scholar of air to become one with
the wind, permitting transport to a target in an outdoor area. Like most of
the air mage's magic, however, the results are sometimes unpredictable,
resulting in the target being missed altogether!

Syntax: Cast 'Greater Invisiblity'

This spell is an enhanced version of the more common magical spell
of invisibility. Drawing more extensively on the magics of air, this

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Cloud Kill' <Optional Target>

Cloud kill is an offensive magic used by magi of the element of air. 
It can be cast on an opponent during combat, doing poison damage and
flooding the room with a noxious gas. This cloud persists in the room,
causing those who are exposed to it to retch and experience a poisonous
affect which can hinder action. The spell can be cast without a target,
and will merely fill the room with the gas.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Gaseous Form'

This spell allows the caster to intersperse his material form with a 
portion of the elemental plane of air. In this gaseous form, the scholar
can pass through cracks in doors, float above the surface of the ground,
and resist physical injury in combat.

~


-1 'GREATER VENTRILOQUate'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Greater Ventriloquate                                        |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Greater Ventriloquate' <Target> <Speaker> <Phrase>

<Target> = Person at which you wish the ventriloquate to occur
<Speaker> = Person or thing you wish to appear as speaking
<Phrase> = Phrase to be spoken aloud

Similar to the Ventriloquate spell, Greater Ventriloquate allows a 
scholar of the element of air to make objects appear to speak, even
at a great distance. Like ventriloquate, the target is allowed a save
versus the spell to see whether the caster can successfully deceive them.

~


-1 'ILLUSIONARY OBJECT'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\

     The Guardians of Law are a noble House now under the protection and 
guidance of the god Iandir. The origin of the Guardians may be found 
many centuries ago, when the nobles of the Ipsoli line began offering 
monetary rewards for the apprehension of the land's most notorious 
bandits. This system evolved into a system of laws instituted by the 
Ipsoli, and a corresponding reward put on the head of any who dared to 
violate these laws. Eventually the heroes of Order were received by 
Iandir, who declared that their system was under his divine protection.
     Today, the Guardians of Law are universally recognized by local 
governments as impeccable enforcers of peace and order, and welcomed in 
every city. Any who violate the laws set forth by the Guardians are 
marked for a reward, which is granted to any citizen apprehending the 
criminal. See help reward, help law, and help Iandir for more 
information.
      All who wish to join the Guardians of Law should address a note to
"Guardian" explaining in detail their background, philosophies, and reasons
for desiring to serve. Applicants should then seek the current leaders and 
attempt to prove their worth.

If you're completely new to the World of Avendar, then this file is
for you.

Q: So what exactly is this place, anyway?

A: Avendar: The Crucible of Legends is a MUD set in the
fantasy world of Avendar.

Q: So what is a MUD exactly, anyway?

A: A MUD, (short for multi-user dungeon) is a simulated
world in which multiple users interact with each
other, and the world around them, in the context of their
setting.

Q: So, what is Avendar like anyway?

A: Avendar MUD features a number of things, but probably
the three most important features are:

-Avendar is its own original world, with a unique cast of
classes, people, places and ideas

-Avendar is a role-playing MUD

-Avendar is a MUD which allows for playerkilling

Q: Roleplaying MUD? What does that mean? Do I have to
dress in black and drink blood? Sacrifice babies?

A: What playing on a roleplaying MUD means is that you
take on the role of the character you assume. This means you
don't come here to discuss real life -- you come to step into
a fantasy role. And, no one says you *have* to drink blood.
For more help on this topic, read help ROLEPLAYING.

Q: Playerkilling? What's that all about?

A: On Avendar, part of your interaction with others might
involve a threat to your own well-being by other players.
Part of the reasoning for this is that you really aren't
able to role-play things like the epic struggle between
good and evil without some sort of violence. For more
help on this, read help PLAYERKILLING.

Q: Ok, well, what all sorts of things do people do here?

A: You can do lots of things here. You can go out to kill
creatures and gain experience and improve yourself, go exploring,
meet and interact with other people, or even get in a tussle
with other players. Really, the sky is the limit.

Q: If I keep playing, will Avendar devour my soul?

A: Yes.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


A swordmaster, more than a mere warrior, has devoted his life to
the mastery of various styles, or "forms" of combat. Each
form accomplishes different goals in battle, and can and should
be used strategically. Assuming a form requires mana, and
each round of combat that a form is being used requires mana
(and sometimes stamina) to maintain that form. If you do not
have the mana to pay the cost of the form, the form will drop.
In addition, each form has a counterform, that will cause the
swordmaster to lose his stance, rendering him vulnerable to attack.
Swordmasters must be wielding a sword to assume a form.


Syntax:

Assume <form name>

Example:

Assume Form of the Bear

To drop out of your form all together, use "Assume none"

To get a complete list of forms, type FORMS.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Syntax:

Assume <form name>

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

 Parry is a skill learned  for deflecting  attacks, and is succesful
 more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for full success,

|            Protection from Fire                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: cast 'protection from fire'

This spell is used by water scholars to shield themselves
from the ravages of fire. Surrounding them in a protective
aura, it reduces fire related damage. The aura may only
be used on the caster's own person, due to the necessary
attunement with the elemental forces of water.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'rune of life' <target weapon>

The rune of life is one of the mystical sigils used by 
water scholars to render healing. The rune of life is applied
to a particular weapon, causing the target to heal the wielder
periodically if the weapon is used in combat. Each rune
requires a loss of mana while it is in existence, as they
use the scholar's conduit to the elemental plane of water to
operate succesfully.

The investigate death skill is used by watchers in an effort
to ascertain the person who killed the given corpse. The 
ability is neither perfect, nor does it always work, but it is
nevertheless a useful tool in the watcher's arsenal.

Syntax: Cast 'Mend Wounds' <target>

This spell of the element of water attempts to mend 
the more persistent physical injuries an adventurer 
encounters - broken bones, open wounds, or even 
gouged eyes. The spell is not perfect, but on a victim
afflicted with many such injuries, it will do a great
deal toward restoring function.

|             OOC                                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: OOC <Person> <message>
        OOCOFF
The OOC commands exists for sending our of character 
communication between players. The reason this command
exists is to allow for the inevitable real life troubles that
crop up in a role-playing setting. This command does NOT
exist as a channel for you to use ooc information to help out
your character.

Example of a good usage:

Ooc Jolinn I can't stay for much longer, I'm expecting a phone call.

Example of a bad usage:

Ooc Jolinn I ditched the Yithoul daggers by the griffins for your newbie.

If you do not wish to receive OOC communications, use the OOCOFF command.

Peek is a skill learned by rogues to discern a person or
creature's inventory. An attempt to peek is made automatically

-1 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT NOFOLLOW AUTODATE~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|     AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC                         |
|     NOYELL  AUTOEXIT   AUTOASSIST  AUTODATE                         |
|     AUTOSPLIT  AUTODATE  NOFOLLOW                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Avendar uses various automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always
splitting gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac   : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpses)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat
autodate  : show new dates as ingame day changes
nofollow  : toggles between accepting/not accepting followers
noyell    : prevents involuntarily yells when being attacked
combine   : toggle combining items

color/colour : toggles ANSI colour
brief/compact: toggles between brief/compact descriptions

Typing a command sets the action, typing it again removes it.

~

-1 COMBINE~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|       Combine                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

This command toggles combine mode on and off. In
combine mode, multiple items of the same type are lumped
into one entry.

Ex: If there are three Yithoul daggers lying on the ground,
someone in combine mode would see:

(3)  A dagger of Yithoul design rests here.

A person not in combine mode would see:

       A dagger of Yithoul design rests here.
       A dagger of Yithoul design rests here.
       A dagger of Yithoul design rests here.

Generally speaking, there's no reason to not be in combine mode,
so unless you have a fetish for spam, it's a good idea to keep it on.

-1 SPAM~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|              Spam                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

As you may have noticed, one of our rules is:

*   Unnecessary spamming will not be tolerated.

Just in case you don't know, here's what we mean by spam.
As most of you logged in here are aware, interactive text
based multi-person media applications are a lot of fun, but 
suffer from a number of shortcomings. One of which is the
fact that other users can flood you out of an action by filling
up your screen with garbage and/or useless information.
Your connection really can only support so much information
going either way, so if you receive too much input from the mud,
there's a real danger that none of your output _to_ the mud will
get here. This can be a problem, particularly if your character
is in a dangerous situation (read: most of the time). 

Now, the problem arises when someone maliciously spams you.
An example might be someone typing:

emote slaps you in the face.
Then, repeating this command about 1,000 times, filling up your scream.

Other examples might include (but are not limited too) repeating the same
yell countless numbers of time around town, or sending countless numbers
of repetitive tells to someone.

In short, don't do this. Imms have special monitoring features to tell when
people do a lot of the same command at once, so if one of us is around,
we will most likely notice, and be very upset.

Now, as to the origins of the term "spamming", the term originates 
from a Monty Python Flying Circus sketch (which involves chanting
spam a lot, and repetitively). As to how this first came to its more
general usage on the Internet, this appears to have been lost in the
origins of time.

However, we recommend you consult the Jargon file (available on the web)
for more insight into this and other mysteries.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Profession: Rogue.
Class: Thief.

 One of the world's oldest professions, the thief is a
master of acquisition, stealth, and deception.  Making his living off of
other's wealth, the thief makes his way through the world through the use
of wits and the occasional judicious use of force.  


Thief abilities include:

Waylay, Backstab, Hide, Listen

~

-1 BACKSTAB~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Backstab                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers, and other rogues. 
It can only be attempted with daggers. The damage inflicted by a backstab
is determined by the attacker's level, his weapon skill, his backstab skill,
and the power of his opponent. Only thieves may learn the backstab.

-1 SACRIFICE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       Sacrifice                                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to the gods, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the power of object.

This command allows us to keep down on the clutter by
giving an incentive for destroying loose items, and doing so
in an in character fashion. (Imagine if your character invoked
his god's blessing every time he sacrificed a foes' weapons, etc.)

~

-1 MULTI MULTICHAR MULTICHARING MULTICHARRING MULTIPLAYING MULTIPLAY~

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Multi-Charing is not allowed here at Avendar. What does multi-charing
entail?


I.	Multiple-logins of any kind. This means that we should no two of your
character should ever be playing in the world at the same time.

II.	Using any of the capabilities of one character to benefit another. This
includes, but is not limited too:
          
-Transferring Equipment Between characters. This means not only should you
not log on with both characters and hand eq from one to another, you
should also not leave equipment to be found later by one of your
other characters, or hand equipment to a friend
to give to your other characters.

-Using information available from one character to benefit another.
Basically, if you discover information with one character that your
other character has no business knowing, your other character should
in no way be using this information. This includes things like
locating items with one character for another, using a mage to scout
out invis people for your warrior, information you get over priveleged
channels such as housetells, spells/abilities to locate others, etc.

In general, a good rule of thumb is this: If you're doing something with
one character to benefit another one of your characters, you need to stop,
or if found you will most likely be considered in violation of the rules
of this MUD.

-1  MOBS MOB~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Mobs                                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

"Mobs", short for "Mobiles" are the animate NPC's of
Avendar. Since you should consider your character in
a fantasy world, it's best to refer to mobs as monsters,
creatures, animals, people, or whatever they actually are.

~

-1 BUG TYPO IDEA~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       BUG TYPO                                                      |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Should you happen to run across a bug or a typo, the first thing you
should do is pray about it.  An immortal can gain more information
through a direct conversation with you than he/she probably could
by going through a note.

If there is no response, you should write a note to immortal,
detailing the precise events that lead up to the bug.  Here
are a few things you should try and keep in mind:

-Describe exactly what you think is wrong
-In certain cases, information about your inventory, the room
you're in, what mobs are around you, and what spells you're
affected by will be necessary.  Try to think about which of
the above could possibly bring about said bug, and be sure
to list them.  Try to be as specific as possible.
-If you need to point out a specific room, be sure to give
specific instructions, especially if the room is one of many
(i.e. "The Arien Plains").
-Try not to get upset about the bug. If there's a problem, we 
want just as badly as you to fix it as soon as possible.

IMPORTANT:
The immortals consider the abuse of bugs to be among one of the
graver sins that a mortal can commit.  Do not abuse bugs, or
else you will be treated harshly.

|             Hit Points                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Your characters hit points are a measure of your ability
to sustain physical injuries to your body. If your hit points
ever drop to 0, you become incapacitated and begin to
slowly bleed to death. If your hp drop to ^10, your character
will die. (see help DEATH) As your level increases, so 
too will your hit points. How much your hit points increase
is a function of your character's constitution and class.

-1 MANA~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|               Mana                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Your character's mana is an attempt to quantify mental
concentration and the ability to channel magical energy.
In general, spells will require mana to cast, as well as
some skills which require concentrated effort. As you
progress in level, so too will your mana supply. How much
your mana increases is a function of your character's intellect,
wisdom, and class. Additionally, the 'casting cost' (the
amount of mana it takes to cast a given spell) will often go
down as your character advances in level.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The world of Avendar is home to eight great and ancient
houses. Representing the important political, economic, and
moral forces that shape the world of Avendar, each has come
to fill its -own niche in Avendarian society.

Players may petition to join houses, offering their services
to factions whose interests and beliefs match their own.  

Houses each have a center of power located somewhere in
Avendar. In each of these locations a mystical vault has been
erected, where the houses store their treasures, and focus the
energy of the mystical stones of power. 

To find out more of each of the houses, consult the associated help.

The Houses of Avendar:
--------
The Guardians of the Law
The Champions of Avendar
The Coven of the Shunned
The Raiders of Twilight

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Artifacts of ancient magic pre-dating the Fall of the Alatharya,
the stones of power are focii for channeling various forms
of energy. Used by the varying houses of Avendar to 
utilize the ancient forms that they have preserved, the stones
are kept by them in their vaults to channel this power. 
The more stones a house has acquired, the more powers it
can tap. House abilities are acquired in the follow manner:

Number of Powers                  Number of Stones in Vault
---------------                 ---------------------------------
1	                                    1
2	                                    2
3	                                    4
4	                                    7
5	                                    10

Stones of Power are known to have other effects, some
well-known, others obscure. They are coveted not only by
the houses that use them for their might, but by others
who know their less-popular benfits.

The nature of the stones is such that trying to leave Avendar
results in their loss, and sacrificed or otherwise destroyed 
stones slowly reassemble themselves. Stones appear in all
manner of places -- from simple city streets to the depths of
an arch-demon's prison.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Each of the houses of Avendar has a vault in which it may
places the stones of power to gain skills, store equipment
to use at a later date or to keep from falling into the hands of
the enemy. Items placed in the vault persist even through
reboots/crashes, thereby maintaing the equipment within.
Vaults all have guardians, which behave in a set manner.

The way in which a House's guardian functions is passed down
by word of mouth, in the oral tradition.

If you are raiding a house to gain access to the vault, you will
have to slay the guardian(s) of the house to obtain the magical
item that will give you access to the vault.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The followers of Jolinn are marked with the Sigil of the
Sapphire Spear, mark of Jolinn, Father of the Seas and 
leader of the celestial armies of the light.

Followers of Jolinn ascribe to three main principles:

Purity:

Just as the inevitable result of poison is the death of an
organism, so does evil lead to the death of spirit and those
it corrupts. The followers of Jolinn believe that evil must be 
expunged from the land, before it can corrupt and destroy
everything that is good.

Protection:

The things worth fighting for we do so because they are
worthy of our protection. Above all else, the innocent
must be protected against the depredations of those who
seek to corrupt and taint life with their evil.

Unity:

As an overreaching principle, the followers of Jolinn advocate
brotherhood in the light -- both in opposition to evil and unity
in productive effort to aid the weak. Followers of Jolinn are
known for organizing those of good heart, using this unity of focus
to accomplish great deeds.

Known as the Sons and Daughters of Jolinn, those who follow
the Lord of the Sapphire spear are always good, and very seldom
if never of chaotic ethoi. 

Those who seek to follow Lord Jolinn should seek his presence from one
of the holy places devoted to him in Avendar.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


When you come to the world of Avendar, it's a world where role-playing
is not only encouraged, it's required. This means that in any situation
that presents itself to you here, you should do your best to see and
react as an actual person from Avendar would react.This means that you
shouldn't spend your time discussing the real world, but instead
attempting to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of a fantasy role-playing
environment. Think of yourself as an actor, playing a master role in a
great drama. We guarantee this is even more fun than just playing a
'numbers game'.

-1 CHARACTERS CHARACTER  'CHARACTER CREATION'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Character Creation                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

One of the best ways to think about what you have planned for a character
is to see his or her life as a book of which you are the author. The pages
written with the story of your life, inked in your life's blood. It may
sound a little trite, but if you come to think of your characters in this
way, it's a surefire recipe for role-playing success.

Let's think about the things that a good book has that make for a good
character:

Theme:

Perhaps the most important (and overlooked) aspect of character design is
the theme. What  does it mean for a character to have a theme? It means
that your character has a notion of who he or she is, that this notion is a
definite idea that you wish to explore in the study of your character.

Of course, this doesn't mean that you have to hold to one rigid idea. If
you come upon  something that you think is a lot neater to do with a
character, if you can justify it within the framework of your prior
characterizations, then go right ahead. However, these will be a lot
smoother if you plan them ahead of time. 

Some examples of themes you might want to explore in character design:

Classics:
The Crusader
The Greedy Thief
The Knowledgeable Wizard
The Indomitable Barbarian 

More Difficult (but more rewarding)
The Assassin troubled with the burden of  a Conscience, and struggled with
the implications
of his actions.
The holy templar who doubts his faith, but still keeps the good fight.
The bard who seduces her way to power.
The evil thief who searches, and finds, redemption.
The good warrior seduced by greed, who turns to evil to fulfill his lusts.

These are just examples, but they give you an idea of what a character can
be. And, the more depth you give your character, the more things that are
possible. The character's life is your book, and a good theme is a good way
to start.

Plot:

A book depends on plot to provide a structure and a plan for what the
author intends to show us.  Likewise, your character should have a story.
Questions you might want to answer about your character:

-Where did my character come from in Avendar? 
-What were the factors that determined who my character is today?
-How did my character come to want to/be forced to become an adventurer?

And, once you develop a back story, you need to think about how you'll act
out your characters belief in his or her adventuring career. To make this
interesting, you probably (but not always) want one thing that makes real
books interesting: Conflict.

Having enemies to fight, and challenges to overcome is what makes life
interesting. Unless your character's stated goal is to make friends with
everyone ( a conflict in and of itself, really), you'll end up with some
enemies. Rather than sweating this fact, use it as a source of motivation
and action for your character.

Remember that not all conflicts are vs. other players ^ your particular
character might also be opposed to an idea, and work to change people's
opinion, or even a very difficult locale that symbolizes what he/she feels
is right/wrong with the world.

Characterization:

In general terms, you should work your character function as a real person.
Along with their own implicit philosophy, you might want to give them more
explicit quirks. Maybe your elegant bard has a secret taste for vulgar
peasant wenches, or your dark lord of the void is also an art collector.
Think of the little things that make YOU who you are, and try to think of
ways you can make your character unique.

Tying it all together:

Once you've done all these things, you'll have a character that you will
most likely enjoy devoting a lot of time to. Think of how you might explore
and flesh out your role as you explore. Nothing is set in stone, of course,
but you might consider how your actions tommorow might be dependent on your
beliefs today. And that, in turn, might influence where you'll end up next
week -- the hero who saved the world, or the dark scholar who's one step
away from precipitating Armageddon. Your character is your creation -- try
to make the most of the experience.

-1 VANISH~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|                Vanish                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Using a combination of smoke, mental confabulation and stealth, the skilled
assassin may attempt to vanish. Vanish takes the assassin quickly to a
random location in his or her current area, and may also be used to escape
from a combat situation.

~



-1 TRANCE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|                Trance                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


An enhanced version of the meditative techniques prevalent throughout
Avendar, the skill of keeping the mystic portion of one's consciousness in
a trance state increases like the ability to regain magical potential. 
Like meditation, the trance skill is automatic.

~

-1 WATER~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Water                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Encompassing the powers of healing, protection, and knowledge, scholars of 
this sphere draw their influence from the powers of water. Resonanting with
lawful and good tendencies, scholars who are chaotic or evil cannot choose
this sphere as a discipline.

~

-1 EARTH~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|               Earth                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Focusing on protection, order, and strength, the scholars of this sphere
tap into the elemental powers of earth. Resonating with lawful and neutral
tendencies, scholars who are chaotic cannot choose this sphere as a
discipline.

~

-1 VOID~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|             Void                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Focusing on maledictions, negative energy, and extraplanar manipulation,
scholars of this sphere use the elemental powers of the Void. Resonating
with lawful and evil tendencies, scholars who are good or chaotic cannot
choose this sphere as a discipline.

~

-1 SPIRIT~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Spirit                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Having influence over the powers of  positive energy, freedom, and life and
death, the scholars of this sphere draw their power from the elemental
powers of the spirit. Resonating with chaotic and good tendenices, scholars
who are evil or lawful cannot choose this sphere as a discipline. 

~


-1 AIR~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Air                                                      |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Encompassing the studies of the winds, kinetics, and chaos, scholars of
this sphere channel the elemental power of air. Resonating with chaotic
tendenices, scholars who are lawful cannot choose this phere as
a discipline.

~

-1 FIRE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Fire                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


Having influence over the powers of chaos, thermal energy, and destruction,
scholars of this sphere draw their power from the elemental power of fire.
Resonating with chaotic and evil tendencies, scholars who are lawful or
good cannot choose this sphere as a discipline. 

~

-1 GREATER 'GREATER SPHERE'~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|                Greater                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Scholars who choose both their major and minor spheres of influence in a
single access are given greater access to their chosen elements. Spells
from the greater sphere tend to be more powerful, and represent the
pinnacle of the powers of a given element. Greater spells tend to be more
difficult to find, and are often not taught by the common guildmasters of
most cities.

~

-1 MAJOR 'MAJOR SPHERE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|              Major                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Scholars choose both a major and minor element to learn from. The choice of
a major element determines where most of the scholars spells derive from,
and serves as the scholar's principle focus.

~

-1 MINOR~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|              Minor                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Scholars choose both a major and minor element to learn from. The choice of
a minor element determines a smaller component of the scholar's spell
repertoire than the major choice, furnishing the scholar with a chance to
gain more variety in spell types.

~

-1 MAGIC~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Magic                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The forces of magic in Avendar were long ago sundered by a great elemental
catastrophe, which resulted in the ether being split into its elemental
components. Likewise, scholars must now focus their attention on the
elements to gain magical power. To do this, scholars choose a "major" and
"minor" school of influence in a given element. Scholars may choose the
major and minor school to coincide, and thereby gain access to greater
spells. 

Various elemental forces also resonate with given alignment, and scholars
of a given element cannot choose an major or minor sphere directly opposed
to their ethos.

Element           Resonant Alignment

Water              Lawful Good
Earth              Lawful Neutral
Void               Lawful Evil
Spirit             Chaotic Good
Air                Chaotic Neutral
Fire               Chaotic Evil

Remants of ancient magic are said to still reside in the realms, but such
matters are seldom discussed by orthodox scholars, and remains by and large
a study given over to less official studies of magical inquiry.

-1 RAIDER RAIDERS 'RAIDERS OF TWILIGHT'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         The Raiders of Twilight                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

      The Raiders of Twilight are a band of thieves
devoted first and foremost to their own ends. They revel 
in the acquisition of material goods and the satiation of their
primal lusts. Raiders strike with deadly strength, overwhelming 
their enemy with their numbers and ferocity, then taking all that
they can lay their hands upon. Over the years, they have developed
an uncanny ability to find weaknesses in their opponents, and have 
been known to ruthlessly take advantage of them.

Originally known as the Circle of Twelve, the Raiders eventually
grew in strength and numbers.  Their daring exploits made their
names feared throughout Avendar, and brought the attention of the
dark gods, who gave them the power to become the Raiders of Twilight.

Raiders of Twilight are predominantly motivated by greed for 
wealth or power, and use force and cunning to satiate these
desires. Raiders are never lawful, using their position as rogues
outside of the bounds of society to their own advantage.

-1 DESCRIPTION2 DESC2~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|                Extended Description Advice                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


When you make your description, here are some things
to think about:

-Your description should be appropriate to Avendar and
your character: See the help files on ROLEPLAYING and
CHARACTER CREATION

-Your description is what people see when they look at
you. As people can view you in multiple situations, and
with multiple perspectives, the best recourse is to stick
to cold hard fact, namely, what your character physically
looks like.  Start with concrete details such as height,
build, skin/hair/eye color, and whatever else is obvious.
Then expand into details, such as clothing, posture, scars,
and so forth.  See Help Exdesc for more ways to be detailed.

-If you want people to know your history, you should
tell them about it, rather than putting it in your desc.
Furthermore, what a person feels when he/she looks at you
is what that person feels.  Don't dictate to them how you
affect them.  In the words of an English teacher: "Show,
don't tell."

-Your description should not contain actions in response 
to people looking at you -- after all, you don't say "hello"
every single time a person looks at you, nor do you see any
and all people that look at you. Common behaviors are fine 
(a nervous twitch, etc.) 

-Spelling/Grammar: Seeing a sloppily written, badly misspelled
description always makes me cry a little, deep inside. Your
ideas are more clearly understood when you take the time 
to abide by the rules of grammar, like the imms intended.

-Originality: Rather than being yet another ominous figure in
a cloak, why not be something different? Try to let your
description not only reflect your role but help define something
new and unique about it.

-1 GAIN GAINS 'GAIN CONVERT' 'GAIN REVERT'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Gain Convert                                                |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Gain Convert
Syntax: Gain Revert

This skill allows a player to convert their practices into 
training, at the rate of 10 practices into one train, or 8 practices
for one train. 

You must be at an appropriate mob to use this skill. Guildmasters in
larger cities (such as Var Bandor) can all help you convert
your practices into training.

-1 EMOTE EMOTES~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|              Emote                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Emote <message>

The emote command works by emoting an action that you
do to the rest of the room. 

Example:
If your name is Jolinn, and you type:

Emote rambles on and on about killing arch-devils.

Everyone else in the room would see:
"Jolinn rambles on and on about killing arch-devils.",
thereby "emoting" the action to the rest of the room.

-1 CONQUEST~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|               Conquest                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The lords of Conquest seek to dominate the weak, to cull those not suited
for the world from the various races they belong to. Most choose to take
power whereever and however they can, against or with the odds. They
forever seek to prove their prowess in combat, accepting challenges
from all who show themselves worthy. The more physical warriors
dominate using their strength and hardiness, while the magical fighters
tend to crush their enemies with their mental energies. Those who
deem themselves worthy should send a scroll to CONQUEST, and seek
favor from the other conquerors.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Applicants who wish to apply to the Champions should
first submit a note to CHAMPION. In the note, you should
try to answer the following questions:

-Who are you? How did you come to be the  person you are today?
-What are your beliefs? How do these beliefs match with the
philosophy espoused in the CHAMPION help file?
-What do you have to offer the Champions?
-Why, in general, do you want to be a champion?
-What do you see as your own future with the champions, 
and your vision of the future of the order in Avendar?
-What plans do you have to see the ideals of the champions
carried out?

|        Champion                                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The Champions of Avendar are known throughout the realms as
defenders of the light and as evil's chief enemies. Reknowned
for their bravery and devotion to the protection of the innocent,
their order has stood as a bulwark against the forces of darkness
since the War of Fire. 

The champions pay devotion to three principles:

JUSTICE:

The only proper punishment for evil is the destruction of their
plans and capacity to harm the innocent. Contrawise, those of
pure heart must be protected at all costs.

COURAGE:

Champions must show courage in facing evil. Whether facing the hordes
of evil as a lone hero, or as a general directing the armies of the
light, a Champion never allows his fear to overcome his devotion
to the salvation of all Avendar.

MERCY:

Champions must show mercy to those who truely repent of their deeds,
for it is better that one be lead from darkness by thought and deed
than to destroy the body without saving the innocent. Succor
should always be rendered to the innocent, for theirs is the essence
of why a champion fights.

--

Above all, a Champion should and must strive to become the embodiment
of the ideals he or she represents. The Champion strives to be
an example for all of Avendar, and an unstoppable force in the war
against evil.

|             Voidwalk                                                |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Voidwalk'

The experienced scholar of the void through long experience can
bring their own body slightly out of phase with the prime material,
and dwell briefly in the fringes of the void. While in this state, void
scholars can neither be seen nor attacked. Scholars in this state also 
exist partially outside of our plane of existence, so are unable to
interact with the physical world. Upon the termination of the spell, the 
scholar returns to the prime material, where his or her body will have
suffered the effects of prolonged contact with the void.

~


-1 POSSESSION POSESSION POSESION POSSESION~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Possession                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'possession' <mob>

Reaching out through the void, a scholar of the void may attempt
to insinuate his will into the mind of a creature. Successful 
possession attempts result in the scholar assuming control 
of the victim's body. The void scholar's body reminds behind,
where it remains vulnerable to physical attack. To return to their
body, a scholar uses the RELINQUISH command.

~

-1 RELINQUISH~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Relinquish                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Relinquish

Void scholars use the RELINQUISH command to undo
the affects of the POSSESSION spell, returning them to
their own body.

~

-1 TENTACLES~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Tentacles                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'tentacles'

By reaching into the plane of the void, a spellcaster may summon
forth some of the more primitive life forms that inhabit that region.
The result is a growth of black tentacles, which grab at any and all
who enter, leave, or remain in the room with them.

~


-1 LESSER 'LESSER DEMON SUMMON'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Lesser  Demon  Summon                                     |

Syntax: Cast 'Lesser Demon Summon'

One of the spells that typifies magic-users who dabble in the
powers of the void is the summoning of lesser void-dwelling 
entities, or demons. Binding them with the tenants of an ancient
agreement, lesser demons can be made to serve practitioners of
void. The aspiring demon summoner need be wary, however:
demons require a price for their service, and demand it when
summoned. Those who are unwilling or unable to pay the 
price often pay the ultimate penalty. Demons are also more
difficult to control the longer they are bound, and have been
known to break their bonds after enough time has elapsed.
To return a demon to its home plane, the BANISH spell is
used.

-1 'GREATER DEMON SUMMON' 'GREATER DEMON'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Greater Demon Summon                                        |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Summon Greater Demon'

Similar in form to the Lesser Demon Summoning, only a master
scholar of void may attempt this spell. Used to bind demons of
near legendary status from the Void, this spell should only be
attempted with the utmost caution, as greater demons demand
exorbitant prices for their service, and are easily offended if 
their cost is denied. Like lesser demons, the BANISH spell
is used to return them to their home plane.

~


-1 BANISH~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|            Banish                                                   |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Banish' <Demon>

This spell attempts to return a summoned demon to the 
plane of the void, in an attempt to circumvent the demon's
eventual escape from the caster's control.

~

-1 AGONY~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Agony                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Agony' <target>

Under the influence of the sphere of void, this spell can be used
to inflict enormous amounts of pain on another. Creatures or 
persons affected by agony will find that any attempt to perform
a skill or action can be impeded by the affects of the pain, 
resulting in a diminished skill level. Agony also saps the
strength of the affected person, the pain inducing a weakness
in muscular response.

~

-1  POX~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|           Pox                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Pox' <target>

The pox spell attempts to infect the victim with one of the 
wasting illnesses that often infest creatures of places of
great negative energy, such as the Void. Along with a loss 
of strength, it also reduces the ability to act, as they are 
devoured internally by the horrible affliction. Highly 
contagius, more virulent poxes have been known to wipe out
entire villages.
~


-1 DEATHWALK~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|          Deathwalk                                                  |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Deathwalk'

One of the most all encompassing powers of the greater 
scholars of void is the spell of the deathwalk, which inflicts 
not only the caster's immediate surroundings, but an entire
area around him. For the duration of the deathwalk curse, no
corpses may be sacrificed. Most horrifyingly, the corpses of
all creatures slain arise from the slumber of death, animating
by negative energy. These zombies wander the area, roughly
equal in power to the strength of their form in life.

~

-1 SUPPRESS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Suppress                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Suppress'

This spell formes an extraplanar shield of negative energy
to encompass an area, blocking attempts to recall to other 
areas of the prime material plane.

~




-1 FEAR 'POWER WORD FEAR'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|       Power Word Fear                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Sytanx: Cast 'Power Word Fear' <target>


Uttering the true name of a Greater Denizen of the Void, a 
student of the void attempts to influence then mind of a person
with one massive burst of negative energy. When cast in
combat, if successful, it forces a person to flee. In addition,
it will prevent the victim from initating combat for the
duration of the spell. There is also a small chance of the
fright being too much for the victim's heart, resulting in
death.

~


-1 'CLOAK OF THE VOID' ~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|        Cloak of the Void                                            |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Cloak of the Void'

This spell wraps the caster in a cloak of negative energy,
making them resistant to damage in most forms. Due to the
nature of the shield, the caster receives additional damage
from holy (positive) energy attacks. The spell requires 
considerable concentration, and requires additional mana 
each hour to maintain.

~

-1 COMMAND 'COMMAND WORD'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|     Command Word                                                    |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Cast 'Command Word' <target> <action>


This spell uses a carefully constructed net of negative energy
to manipulate the victim into performing a single action.
If cast successfully, the victim will be compelled to perform
a single action.

Example:

Cast 'Command Word' Andrion drop all

This would compel a person in the room named Andrion to drop all.

~

-1 'FIND FAMILIAR'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
|         Find Familiar                                               |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

One of the most time consuming spells an initate of the void can
cast is the spell of find familiar. Delving through the prime
material, the magi seeks a familiar which resonates with his
or her own dark soul. The familiar a scholar takes is determined
at birth, and does not change throughout the scholar's life.
The coming of a familiar brings more health and a greater ability
to channel magic for the caster, but carries with it a price: Should
a familiar die, the caster will bear the pain of its loss until their
own death. Familiars also have special abilities, that the caster
will have to discover on their own.

~


-1 NEXUS~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       NEXUS                                                         |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: cast 'nexus' <anchor>

By achoring an endpoint to a place where the <anchor> target is,
the caster is able to tunnel through the void, and open a temporary
gateway that can be walked through. The targetting of the endpoint
follows much the same rules as the gate (help GATE) spell. This
spell is extremely taxing, and the trip through a nexus can be
disorienting.

~



-1 REQUEST~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       REQUEST                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: request <item> <requestee>

With request, a person who follows the light can ask to receive
an item from a good creature or person of the land (non-PC). You may
only request within 5 levels of yourself. If successful, and the
person you request from also walks in the light, they will entrust you
with the item, assuming that since you are asking, you have a greater
need. By requesting an item, you, a lightwalker, are removing that
persons ability to defend themselves, and should consider that
accordingly. (see also: help ROLEPLAYING)

~

-1 DAMAGE~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       DAMAGE                                                        |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Damage done varies depending on many factors, including the
quality of your weapon, additional modifiers to your ability
to do damage from equipment or spells, and skills such as enhanced
or brutal damage.

In order from the least damage to the most, the damages are as follows:

miss          maul          DISMEMBER      ANNHILATE
scratch       decimate      MASSACRE       ERADICATE
graze         devastate     MANGLE         
hit           maim          DEMOLISH
injure        MUTILATE      DEVASTATE
wound         DISEMBOWEL    OBLITERATE

At the far reaches of damage, UNSPEAKABLE things have been known
to occur.

~


-1 REWARD~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       REWARD                                                        |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

       Those in violation of the laws set forth by the Guardians of Law 
are marked as targets of Iandir's wrath by the appearance of (REWARD) 
upon their person. Any citizen of Avendar who takes the life of such a 
criminal is bestowed a divine gift from Iandir.
       For those who have not reached the rank of hero, the reward takes 
the form of battle experience, aiding them in attaining their next rank. 
For those who have reached the rank of hero, the reward takes the form 
of partial practice sessions.

~


-1 LAW LAWS~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       LAWS                                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The laws are as follows.  These laws apply to any region which has been
designated by the Guardians, and will be enforced mercilessly.  Any who
break the law will be marked for a Reward.  They will then be hunted by
the Guardians, and by many of the land, for the god Iandir will reward
their killer.  For more information about rewards and those who may
receive them, read the scroll entitled "help reward."
  Areas designated as law-observant are as follows: Var Bandor, Krilin 
Fortress, Earendam, Merchant Headquarters, Gaald, the Patrician's Palace
and the Hall of Law.

1. Any person who attacks another person in a law-observant area will be 
marked for a reward. Members of the Guardians may attack one who has 
been marked at any time, for it is their calling to punish the 
law-breakers. Guardians may choose to deputize non-chaotic people, who 
are then temporarily allowed to attack criminals in law-observant areas. 
These are the only exceptions.

2. Any person who steals or attempts to steal from another within a law-
observant area will be marked for a reward. The following offenses will 
be considered theft: Taking items from another person's corpse without
the owner's consent, taking items from the corpse of a recently-slain
criminal, stealing items from another person's pet or mercenary or the 
corpse thereof, and the actual act of stealing an item from another 
person's possession. Members of the Guardians of Law, or deputies operating 
under the instructions of a member of the Guardians of Law may at times take
items from a person's corpse in the line of duty. This includes holding
items to prevent theft and confiscating items to punish an offender.

3.  Any person who attacks a guildguard or the guard of one of the three
Guardian offices within a law-observant area will be marked for a reward. 
Guardians of Law may attack guildguards in pursuit of criminals.

4. Any non-Guardian who enters the Hall of Law will be marked for a reward.

5. Any person who recklessly uses a deadly skill within a law-observant
area will be marked for a reward. A deadly skill will be defined as a
skill or spell that can cause bodily damage to a person. Reckless use will
be defined as use that has the potential to affect bystanders (ie, area-
affect spells). Included are skills that make an area dangerous to
travel, such as Wall of Fire or traps.

6. Any person who directly aids a marked person will also be marked for 
a reward. This includes supplying the marked person with potions, 
scrolls, healing, refreshment, food, water, weapons, armor, and other 
means of aid. Those who choose a marked person as a travelling companion 
are advised to be very cautious, lest they run afoul of the law.

-1 'PLAYER KILLING' 'PLAYER KILL' PLAYERKILLING PKILL PK PKING~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       PLAYERKILLING                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Here in Avendar, playerkilling starts at level 11. This means
that once you reach level 11, you may attempt to attack other 
people. Contrawise, other people may attempt to attack you.
Acceptable targets for playerkilling (or "pking") are players
whose experience total is within 30% of yours, or whose level
is +/- 8 levels of your own. To attack another player, use
the MURDER command, which is the principle way of starting a 
fight with another player. 

Mechanics aside though, here's the real reason we have player-
killing here: We think that any role-playing environment
without it suffers a critical loss. Imagine playing a 
holy crusader, dedicated to stamping out any and all evil in
the land. Now, imagine a despicable thief, who makes his living
by stealing the gold of the innocent, and sliding his blade
between the ribs of whoever displeased him. Without player
killing, imagine what would happen if these two met!
Would they just exchange curses? Yell at each other? Why
does the warrior fight if the only evils he can vanquish
the monsters of the realm? Is the thief doomed to preying only
on innocent computer controlled creatures?

We here think that a world without playerkilling is a world
without the vibrancy that a real world *should* have. In order
to really play the roles you've chosen for yourself in our
fantasy world, you need to be able to really interact
with others. For this to happen, this interaction has to occur
on a more than superficial level - one player has to be
able to threaten what the other holds most dear, and the
stuff that really matters, such as the ideals of the participants,
get played out along this backdrop. Players can live, breathe,
fight, and die here on Avendar, and that's the world the
way we like it.

Surving in a world with other well-armed, vicious, and often
bloodthirsty players can be a bit hairy, particularly if you
aren't used to it. If you put in the time and effort though,
you can learn the secrets to survival. Until then, here are
a few tips that will (hopefully) spare you some harsh lessons.


- Know who's out there: Check "who pk" often, and look for
  people who might be out to get you. Keep in mind, though, 
  that there are lots of ways that another person might 
  hide themselves without you seeing them.

- Be wary: Always check "where" and "where pk" to be on your
  guard for people who are in your area. Just as above, though,
  keep in mind that there are ways for people to hide themselves
  from your sight.

- Ranking: You're never more vulnerable when out getting experience.
  Avoid areas that are easy to get to, unless you really want
  to stay on your toes. Watch out especially for the places that
  lots of people go to rank, or that are really near town: these
  are the most likely to become killing fields unless you're
  careful.

- Knowledge: Knowing the terrain is one of the best ways
  to kill/or avoid being killed. Since everyone has to start
  small, consider learning a very few areas very well rather than
  knowing a very little bit about everything. This is particularly
  true of places you might be out getting experience in, since
  these are the most dangerous.

- Preparation: Always be prepared. Be aware of all the magical
  aids that are out there, so you can use them to your own
  advantage (or, so you'll know what you're up against.) Rather
  than wearing yourself down for that final kill before your
  group rests, don't gamble your life away by getting your
  health and mana down to near zero. Skilled playerkillers
  are always prepared, and you should be too.

- Know when to run: While it's true that some characters won't
  run away, even the bravest man needs to know when the odds
  are completely against him. Remember, if you're fighting
  a prepared, skilled opponent, he's at a big advantage over
  someone who's been out killing monsters.

- Avoid becoming a victim: Remember that the guy who's out
  there chasing you is a person too. Learn to prey on
  *his* fears, and *his* ignorance, rather than fall victim
  to your own. Keep your cool in a pinch, and used what
  you've learned to your advantage.

  and finally...

- Don't give up! Even if you got slaughtered, think of it as
  a learning experience. Try to keep logs of your sessions,
  and see where you went wrong, or where you might have acted
  differently. Use this information to help you survive the
  NEXT time. And, keep a list of people who have gotten you
  in the past: you can often use your desire for vengeance
  as an incentive in learning the ropes.

Class:      Bandit.

  Bandits are the ruffians of the world of Avendar. They specialize
in the use of brute force in acquiring material goods.  Unlike a
thief, a bandit prides himself not on stealth, but rather the swift
brutality of a highwayman.  Scorning the elegant solution, the bandit uses
whatever tools he has at hand to acquire what he wishes.  Do to their
somewhat brutish tempers, bandits tend not to be noted for obedience to any
formal notion of law, and consequently often roam the roads of Avendar.  
 
Bandit Abilities Include:
 
Waylay Loot Plunder Stash

the pursuit of their craft.  They strike from the shadows, using
knife, poison, and dart as their tools.  Assassins each have their own

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Profession: Warrior.
Class:      Barbarian.

  Savage warriors of the plains, barbarians excel at brute force.
Rather than being formally trained in combat they instead acquire
their lessons from the harsh realities of a life given over to rage

those who embrace the law and instead prefer to remain unbound by excessive
rules or protocol.  Allowing their rage to consume them, they become
formidable opponents.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Profession: Templar.

  Templars are warriors who have trained in the ways and means of
combining sword and spell.  Unlike scholars, who diversify in their studies,
templars only major in one sphere of elemental influence.  Known far and
wide as some of the greatest leaders Avendar has produced, templars are
often seen leading the charge into battle, or directing the forces of
varying factions.  Due to the amount of time spent studying other matters,
the alignment and ethos of a templar must be resonant with their elemental
sphere.

-1 AVENDAR~

|       AVENDAR                                                       |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Avendar began as a hobby, unopened to the public, in September
of 1997. In November 1997, a core group of immortals left the muds they
played to dedicate their time to this project. Working all hours of
the day and night, they produced the first iteration of the world in
which you stand, which opened in January of 1998.

Avendar began as merely a derivative of Rom2.4b, originally named
"Pantheon". Now, it begins to take on life of its own. It has integrated
mob and object programs, "MobMemory" and "ObjMemory", hundreds of new
skills and spells, and entirely replaced the world once common to Rom,
with an entirely original fantasy mythos.

The development continues as Avendar is now fully in production.  
Our primary objectves are a highly interactive world, lots of originality,
and a world where roleplaying is emphasized, and anything is possible. Our
original area set is growing as we find new immortals worthy of adding
to the staff, and as we revamp older areas with our newer code
developments. Thanks for being a part of this.

The creators of Avendar wish to thank our predecessors, the
authors of DIKU, Merc, ROM; the creators and maintainors of
The Carrionfields, a progenitor of our efforts; Marc Mahoney and
Chris Papadimitriou for their early efforts, as well as Xurinos,
wherever you're at.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Thera's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as 
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for
the highest quality stones.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Suicide YES

The suicide command allows you to take your own life, when given
a YES argument. 

Note: No charming spell or skill should ever allow you to command
another player or npc to commit suicide. If you discover that you
can, it is a bug that should be reported.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' Bob. Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.  Using 'ALL' will not
work with arrows.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: order <target> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.

Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.  SIT can be used to sit on
the floor, or in conjunction with furniture.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' and 'gt' are synonymous with 'GTELL'.

YELL sends a message to all players within your current area.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

Use QUIET if you do not wish to recieve tells.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.

It is recommended that you avoid using passwords that are easily
guessed by those who know you either in real life or in character.
"Easy to guess" includes things like your real life name, your
birthday, your character's name, or any permutation fo the above or
similar things. Also try to avoid choosing a dictionary word as
a password. If you absolutely MUST choose a dictionary word, try
to choose something obscure, and to append special characters or
numbers to the password.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within eight levels of
your own.

Use the NOFOLLOW (NOF) command if you wish to toggle accepting followers.

-1 QUIT SAVE~

|       QUIT SAVE                                                     |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT only in safe areas. Safe areas
include cities, guilds, houses, or any of several other special safe
areas. 

When you re-enter the game you will be back in the same room.

WARNING: Losing link is not the same thing as quitting. You will eventually
leave the game if you lose link, but before you do, you will be vulnerable
to mob or pk death. This is done to prevent abuse.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

In character, the act of quitting should be considered as your character
retiring to an inn, or going about personal business instead of adventuring.
Because of this fact, it is considered -extremely- bad roleplaying to
quit to avoid any in character consequences of your actions.

~

-1 SPLIT~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       SPLIT                                                         |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).

Examples:
split 30        --> split 30 silver
split 20 50     --> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10     --> split 10 gold

If you with to share money with your group when you loot it from a 
corpse of pick it up off the ground, see HELP AUTO.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

Use single quotes (the ' character) around the name of any skill or
spell with multiple words. (Ex: prac 'wall of water')

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum of 75%. 
You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.

|       TRAIN                                                         |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per five levels.

What you should train depends greatly on what sort of character you
are playing.  To be safe, practicing Wisdom and Constitution as high
as possible first are recommended.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~


56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

59 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

57 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

57 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

53 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

56 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

56 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

58 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

55 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

57 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

56 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

56 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

57 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~
57 SMITE~
Syntax: smite <charector>
Smite takes the targets hp/mana/mv down by half for everytime you smite
them. When you get hit by a smite, you know someone is getting angry.
~

55 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

54 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

54 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

52 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

52 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

52 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~

52 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

56 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

53 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

53 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

55 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

52 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

59 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

55 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

54 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

51 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>

Syntax: wiznet

	wiznet status

the wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~
51 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~

Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
	cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.

Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the

of the bull is used to strike more damaging blows at the opponent,
sacrificing accuracy as a consequence.


~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       FORM OF THE CRAB                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Crab:

When a blademaster assumes the form of the crab, he imitates
the motion of the blue shelled beach crab, sidling his way
toward his foe, then delivering a pincer strike, using his
weapons to disarm his opponent's weapons. A swordmaster
must be dual wielding to use the form of the crab.


~

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Boar:

A general purpose offensive form, swordmasters modelling their
attacks after the charging boar increase their ability to
hit and do damage to the foe, at the expense of making themselves
easier to hit. As a swordmaster advances in rank, this form
becomes more effective.

~


-1 REED 'FORM OF THE REED'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       FORM OF THE REED                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the reed:

In the form of the reed, the swordmaster focuses all of abilities
on using his weapon to beat back his opponents attack. Bending
like a reed in the wind, he diverts his foe's attacks in 
Avendar's greatest defensive form. This attention does not 
come without a price, however: The number of attacks the 
swordmaster can make is drastically reduced.

~

-1 SERPENT 'FORM OF THE SERPENT'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|    FORM OF THE SERPENT                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Serpent:

The counterpart to the form of the bull, the form of the serpent
is used by a swordmaster to make strikes more accurately at their
foes, while reducing their ability to do damage.


~

-1 MONKEY 'FORM OF THE MONKEY'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       FORM OF THE MONKEY                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Monkey:

assumed for defensive purposes. While a swordmaster
parries less often than in the form of the reed, he loses
fewer attacks.

~

-1 EAGLE 'FORM OF THE EAGLE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|      FORM OF THE EAGLE                                              |

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The form of the cat is used by swordmasters to delay and
confuse their opponent. Drawing their opponent into a maze
of feints and counterstrikes, the unwary will find themselves
unable to accomplish their intended actions.

~


-1 HAWK 'FORM OF THE HAWK'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       FORM OF THE HAWK                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Hawk:

Swordmasters who employ the form of the hawk do so for
a variety of reasons. Dancing through the opponents blows
like a nimble hawk, the swordmaster finds that his ability
to protect himself increases. Moving rapidly from place
to place, the swordmaster moves with an elegant grace,
dodging attempts to trip up his motion. Those who attempt
to trip a swordmaster in the form of the hawk will expose themselves
to a round of attacks.

~


-1 MONGOOSE 'FORM OF THE MONGOOSE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       FORM OF THE MONGOOSE                                          |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Mongoose:

form find themselves capable of delivering more attacks 
in combat than before. With each successful attack, an additional
attack may be attempted.

~

-1 SPIDER 'FORM OF THE SPIDER'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|     FORM OF THE SPIDER                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Spider:

longer fights than they had prepared for. Drawing their opponents
into a complicated series of strikes, the swordmaster tires 
their opponent considerably, striking and withdrawing, pulling
the unwitting opponent into his trap.

~


-1 PANTHER 'FORM OF THE PANTHER'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|    FORM OF THE PANTHER                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Panther:

Mimicking the stealthy motions of the great jungle panthers,
swordmasters move silently through combat, dodging attempts
by their opponent to bash them to the ground. This stealth
also makes it difficult for their opponent's to determine
the direction a swordmaster withdraws from a fight.

~


-1 WHIRLWIND 'FORM OF THE WHIRLWIND'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|   Form of the Whirlwind                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Whirlwind:

to strike at all foes who are in combat with him. Moving like a whirlwind
among his foes, swordmasters have been known to triumph even when
vastly outnumbered.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Mockingbird:

other warriors. Mirroring the motions of his opponent, the 
swordmaster in the form of the mockingbird distracts the opposing
warrior, allowing the user to block the complicated special
moves of their opponent.

~

/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|     Form of the Dragon                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Dragon:

Modelling this offensive form after the legendary dragons, a
swordmaster in this form sacrifices some of his own ability to
parry and instead begins a series of ferocious attacks against his
opponent, drastically reduce their ability to parry.

~

-1 ROSE 'FORM OF THE ROSE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       Form of the Rose                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Form of the Rose:

The form of the rose is one of the most intricate yet visually
impressive form of swordmasters. Turing their opponents attack
against them, at every successful parry they have a chance to 
strike a damaging slice at their opponent.

~


-1 BEAR 'FORM OF THE BEAR'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       Form of the Bear                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The Form of the Bear:

Like the great bears, swordmasters in this form attain a new 
mastery of striking and damaging their foes. Reducing their own
ability to parry, they focus on making their sword strikes
more accurate and more damaging, mauling their foes.

~


-1 BERSERK~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       Berserk  	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Berserk

Barbarians have the ability to drive themselves into a mindless 
frenzy, a state known as berserking. A barbarian gains enormous
strength from this rage, hewing down foes with even greater ferocity. 
On the other hand, in his lust for battle a barbarian is often
unable to distinguish between friend and foe, and will likely 
apply his blade equally to all who stand before him. The barbarian
will often be heedless of his own health, but might find the strength
to fight well beyond his normal limits.

~

-1 SAVAGERY~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       Savagery	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Savagery

Barbarian warriors are known for their ferocity in battle and ability to with
stand physical blows. Their technique of savagery consists of focusing 
on the battle at hand so they completely ignore pain, lesser blows, and other
distractions. This allows them to resist the affects of physical attacks to an
amazing degree. On the other hand, while under the influence of savagery 
barbarians are liable to ignore oncoming magical attacks, and consequently 
greater damage from supernatural sources.

~

-1 BRUTAL 'BRUTAL DAMAGE'~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       BRUTAL DAMAGE                                                 |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Barbarian warriors are trained to wield their weapons with such strength and
ferocity that they are able to inflict damage beyond a normal fighter's enhanced
damage. This awesome capability is quiveringly refered to as brutal damage.


~

-1 GRAPPLE~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       GRAPPLE  	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Grapple <Victim>

The barbarian warrior's fighting style consists of brutal methods, 
not the least of which is the maneuver known as grapple. Grappling
is similar to the more common bash technique, with the difference 
that the barbarian strikes his opponent with such force as to cause
considerable damage. This both can stun the victim and inflict serious
pain. If performed successfully, a grapple can prevent a spellcaster 
from manuevering properly for successful completion of spells.



~


-1 HEW~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       HEW		                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

When a barbarian wields an axe, he is able to take advantage of the weapon's cleaving
property. By taking an opponent unaware, a barbarian has a small chance of hewing
his foe in half, causing instant death. Even if the hewing does not succeed entirely,
the victim is likely to suffer enormous wounds.


~


-1 HUMAN~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       HUMAN		                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

One of the youngest races in existance, Humans are perhaps the most
numerous of all sentients in the realm.  Being very flexible, and
often unpredictable, they can thrive in any sort of environment, and
have an aptitude for a wide variety of things.

The benchmark that most other races are judged by, Humans can be
considered as being very average.  They have no significant
strengths, but have no notable vulnerabilities.

Humans may be any alignment and any class.

~

-1 CH'TAREN CHTAREN~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       CH'TAREN	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Whether these unusual creatures are refugees from the Realm of Spirit 
or from some other more bizarre outer plane is unknown, but the ch'taren 
are here to stay. Ch'taren appear as tall, slender humanoids with 
shimmering golden skin. It is believed that they do not exist entirely 
within this plane, as they are observed to be slightly translucent. As a 
race, they are noted not only for their ability at magic, but also their 
free-spirited nature and good intentions.

Due to the fact that they only partially exist in the Prime Material,
ch'taren naturally resist the blows of physical weapons. Their affinity
for positive energy makes them particularly vulnerable to negative
attacks.

Ch'taren may not be lawful of ethos, and must be good aligned. They 
may become scholars, templars, thieves, or bard. 
~

-1 SHUDDENI~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       SHUDDENI	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The shuddeni are a loathsome race originating deep within the bowels 
of the earth. Constructing vast cave cities, the shuddeni lived for 
centuries without contact with the other races, during which time they 
enslaved the muscular chaja, perfected their magical arts, and grew 
steadily in power. Then, after thousands of years of solitude, the 
shuddeni burst forth upon Avendar with a hatred and destruction 
unmatched among races.

The shuddeni appear as man-height humanoids with pale gray, 
deeply-wrinkled skin. Usually stick-thin, the shuddeni are known for 
their physical agility and the strength of their minds. One of their 
most unusual features is the fact that they are eyeless, using another 
little-understood sense to detect the world around them. Also, because 
of their long association with evil and darkness, the shuddeni resist 
void-based attacks and are vulnerable to light-based attacks.

Shuddeni are dedicated to hatred, greed, and cruelty, and may only be 
evil. Shuddeni may become scholars, templars, thieves, assassins, 
watchers, swordmasters and bards.

~


-1 NEFORTU~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       NEFORTU 	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The nefortu are a race of short, winged creatures with hairless, 
leathery skin ranging from brown to black, and long, pointed ears. It is 
speculated that they are distant cousins of the great bats, but the 
similarity is slight, although they have retained the ability to fly.

Known far and wide as tricksters, their deceptions often hide a 
malevolent bent. They excel at the roguish skills, as well as having 
some small ability in magic. 

Nefortu may be neutral or evil, and may become scholars, templars, 
thieves, or assassins.

~


-1 AELIN~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       AELIN    	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

One of the most regal of races, the Aelin are also one of the
oldest.  Their noble blood runs deep, and is a considerable source         
of pride for those who bear it.  Status in society is of the utmost
importance to Aelin, and appearance is always a consideration.

The Aelin appear as delicate humans, usually with light-colored hair and 
curving, pointed ears. With their wings, Aelin have a great ability to 
move tirelessly, and can travel long distance without rest.  Their 
dexterity allows them to avoid blows most would be hit by, though their 
agility is not limited to physical matters, but extends to politics, 
also. Being often found in the air, they easily resist most lightning
strikes (a circuit is never formed, as they are not grounded), but their
light frame makes them more vulnerable to blunt attacks. 

They are known to be evasive when asked about things they 
either do not know, or wish to keep to themselves.  Truly, they are
the epitome of a member of high society.

Aelin may be any alignment, but may not be chaotic. Aelin may become 
assassins, swordmasters, fighters, thieves, watchers, scholars, templars, and 
bards.

~

-1 ETHRON~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       ETHRON    	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

The Ethron are a forest dwelling people, given over to the ways of 
nature. Mainly good-hearted, many a traveller has been aided as they 
walk softly under the wood of the great trees. While most do not live in 
cities, their understanding of all facets of nature results in Ethron's 
diverse ethos.

Ethron are slightly shorter than mankind, averaging five feet in 
height. They are easily recognized by the greenish tint to their skin.
Due to their understanding of woods lore, ethron heal and can recuperate
mental energy in forests. Contrawise, large cities and indoor locations
can impair an Ethron's health.

The Ethron may be good or neutral in alignment, and may become rangers, 
druids, scholars, and templars.

|       ALATHARYA    	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

After many centuries of dominating the populace of the realm,
the Alatharya have truly declined in influence.  After their leaders
questioned the power of the Gods and in their pride challenged them,
the Chosen were struck down by the powers of the heavens.  When the
heavens struck down the Alatharya, a cataclysm ensued, changing the
face of the land, and destroying the power of the Alatharya.

After being struck down, the Alatharya were stripped of their
mental ability by the heavens.  However, their physical prowess and
durability was not infringed upon, and they are still one of the most
resiliant races about. Today, the Alatharya appear as enormous humans, 
most with a silvery tint to their skin, and flowing white hair. Due to 
their large size, (average nine feet) they are somewhat resistant to 
physical attacks, and are able to wield some two-handed weapons
in a single hand.

Because of their racial history, the Alatharya are unwilling to enter 
the battle between good and evil, but rather stay decidedly neutral. 
Alatharya may become barbarians, gladiators, fighters, rangers, and 
bandits.

-1 SRRYN~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       SRRYN    	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

One of the oldest of the sapient races in the realm, the Srryn are
nevertheless the least developed.  Their evolution came about very
quickly as some reptilian beings came out of the swamps and bayous
and began to walk erect, but seemed to halt not a great deal past that.
Still residing in the swamps of the realm, the Srryn seem to have an
ability to merge into the area without being sensed by other races.

Possessing a sub-human intelligence and an innately vicious nature,
Srryn are prone to destruction and carnage, and lack a great deal of
discretion in their violence.  Their cruel nature leads them to enjoy
torturing their enemies, and other similarly evil acts.

Due to the fact that they are cold-blooded, Srryn have a great
susceptibility to the cold, and an aptitude for heat.

Srryn may be neutral or evil, and may become templars, all warriors,
thieves, bandits, or assassins.

-1 KANK KANKORAN~
/---------------------------------------------------------------------\
|       KANKORAN    	                                              |
\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Nomadic wolves, the Kankoran are perhaps the race which most
shuns civilization.  They generally will form a patriarichal society
which is based on the concepts of the hunt, leadership, and the right 
of the strong to rule the weak, for the benefit of the tribe or pack.

Kankoran can generally be found beyond the mountains to the 
north, where the climate is far cooler, and barren plains can be found.
However, several packs have wandered southward toward the center of
the realm, and some Kankoran have even been known to leave their
packs in order to mingle with society, though this is frowned upon.

A race founded on working together in order to survive, 
Kankoran are generally able to endure a great deal of hardship, but 
are also quite capable of considerable agility when it proves 
necessary.  Their fur leaves them vulnerable to flame, but it also
protects them from the cold.

Kankoran may not be lawful, and may become barbarians, gladiators, 
swordmasters, rangers, thieves, bandits, templars, or assassins.

This skill is used by thieves and bandits to remove an
article of clothing from an unconscious or sleeping person.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/


The caladaran are reknowned throughout Avendar for their wisdom. 
Tall, gentle creatures with odd bark-like skin, they tend to live either 
in forests or among the mountains, where they are known for their 
secluded lifestyles. Recently, however, many Caladaran have been known 
to descend into the towns, mixing with civilization and crowds. Few in 
number, the Caladaran are long-lived and reknowned for their skills as 
sages, refusing direct physical confrontation.

Due to this tendency to avoid physical violence and to seek a more
spiritual mode of existence, caladaran tend to regain health less rapidly
than other races. However, this passive mode of existence allows more
time for meditation, allowing mental energy to be regained more
rapidly.
    
Caladaran may be good or neutral, and may not be chaotic in 
nature. They may become druids, scholars, and bards.

them, winning the animal's loyalty. Only animals may be befriended,

\---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Syntax: Tan corpse <armor type>

Rangers possess the ability to tan the hides from corpses they find.

Syntax: Call Animal

Drawing upon their closeness with nature, rangers may call upon an
animal for aid. The type of animal summoned will depend on the terrain
